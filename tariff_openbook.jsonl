TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners  economic policies that suppress domestic wages and con-sumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national secu- rity and economy of the United States. That threat has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global trading system. I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this threat. On January 20, 2025, I signed the America First Trade Policy Presidential Memorandum directing my Administration to investigate the causes of our country s large and persistent annual trade deficits in goods, including the economic and national security implications and risks resulting from such deficits, and to undertake a review of, and identify, any unfair trade practices by other countries. On February 13, 2025, I signed a Presidential Memo-randum entitled   Reciprocal Trade and Tariffs,   that directed further review of our trading partners  non-reciprocal trading practices, and noted the rela-tionship between non-reciprocal practices and the trade deficit. On April 1, 2025, I received the final results of those investigations, and I am taking action today based on those results. Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base  inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing capacity  undermined critical supply chains  and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adver-saries. Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits are caused in substantial part by a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships. This situation is evidenced by disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers that make it harder for U.S. manufacturers to sell their products in foreign markets. It is also evidenced by the economic policies of key U.S. trading partners insofar as they suppress domestic wages and consumption, and thereby demand for U.S. exports, while artificially increasing the competitive-ness of their goods in global markets. These conditions have given rise to the national emergency that this order is intended to abate and resolve. For decades starting in 1934, U.S. trade policy has been organized around the principle of reciprocity. The Congress directed the President to secure reduced reciprocal tariff rates from key trading partners first through bilateral trade agreements and later under the auspices of the global trading system. Between 1934 and 1945, the executive branch negotiated and signed 32 bilateral reciprocal trade agreements designed to lower tariff rates on a VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:04 Apr 04, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 07APE1.SGM 07APE1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC215042 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 65   Monday, April 7, 2025   Presidential Documents reciprocal basis. After 1947 through 1994, participating countries engaged in eight rounds of negotiation, which resulted in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and seven subsequent tariff reduction rounds. However, despite a commitment to the principle of reciprocity, the trading relationship between the United States and its trading partners has become highly unbalanced, particularly in recent years. The post-war international economic system was based upon three incorrect assumptions: first, that if the United States led the world in liberalizing tariff and non-tariff barriers the rest of the world would follow  second, that such liberalization would ultimately result in more economic convergence and increased domestic consumption among U.S. trading partners converging towards the share in the United States  and third, that as a result, the United States would not accrue large and persistent goods trade deficits. This framework set in motion events, agreements, and commitments that did not result in reciprocity or generally increase domestic consumption in foreign economies relative to domestic consumption in the United States. Those events, in turn, created large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits as a feature of the global trading system. Put simply, while World Trade Organization (WTO) Members agreed to bind their tariff rates on a most-favored-nation (MFN) basis, and thereby provide their best tariff rates to all WTO Members, they did not agree to bind their tariff rates at similarly low levels or to apply tariff rates on a reciprocal basis. Consequently, according to the WTO, the United States has among the lowest simple average MFN tariff rates in the world at 3.3 percent, while many of our key trading partners like Brazil (11.2 percent), China (7.5 percent), the European Union (EU) (5 percent), India (17 percent), and Vietnam (9.4 percent) have simple average MFN tariff rates that are significantly higher. Moreover, these average MFN tariff rates conceal much larger discrepancies across economies in tariff rates applied to particular products. For example, the United States imposes a 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicle imports (with internal combustion engines), while the European Union (10 percent), India (70 percent), and China (15 percent) impose much higher duties on the same product. For network switches and routers, the United States imposes a 0 percent tariff, but for similar products, India (10 percent) levies a higher rate. Brazil (18 percent) and Indonesia (30 percent) impose a higher tariff on ethanol than does the United States (2.5 percent). For rice in the husk, the U.S. MFN tariff is 2.7 percent (ad valorem equivalent), while India (80 percent), Malaysia (40 percent), and Turkey (an average of 31 percent) impose higher rates. Apples enter the United States duty-free, but not so in Turkey (60.3 percent) and India (50 percent). Similarly, non-tariff barriers also deprive U.S. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets around the world. The 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE) details a great number of non- tariff barriers to U.S. exports around the world on a trading-partner by trading-partner basis. These barriers include import barriers and licensing restrictions  customs barriers and shortcomings in trade facilitation  technical barriers to trade (e.g., unnecessarily trade restrictive standards, conformity assessment procedures, or technical regulations)  sanitary and phytosanitary measures that unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering safety objectives  inadequate patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark regimes and inad-equate enforcement of intellectual property rights  discriminatory licensing requirements or regulatory standards  barriers to cross-border data flows and discriminatory practices affecting trade in digital products  investment barriers  subsidies  anticompetitive practices  discrimination in favor of do-mestic state-owned enterprises, and failures by governments in protecting labor and environment standards  bribery  and corruption. Moreover, non-tariff barriers include the domestic economic policies and practices of our trading partners, including currency practices and value- added taxes, and their associated market distortions, that suppress domestic VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:04 Apr 04, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 07APE1.SGM 07APE1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC215043 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 65   Monday, April 7, 2025   Presidential Documents consumption and boost exports to the United States. This lack of reciprocity is apparent in the fact that the share of consumption to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States is about 68 percent, but it is much lower in others like Ireland (27 percent), Singapore (31 percent), China (39 percent), South Korea (49 percent), and Germany (50 percent). At the same time, efforts by the United States to address these imbalances have stalled. Trading partners have repeatedly blocked multilateral and plurilateral solutions, including in the context of new rounds of tariff negotia-tions and efforts to discipline non-tariff barriers. At the same time, with the U.S. economy disproportionately open to imports, U.S. trading partners have had few incentives to provide reciprocal treatment to U.S. exports in the context of bilateral trade negotiations. These structural asymmetries have driven the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficit. Even for countries with which the United States may enjoy an occasional bilateral trade surplus, the accumulation of tariff and non-tariff barriers on U.S. exports may make that surplus smaller than it would have been without such barriers. Permitting these asymmetries to continue is not sustainable in today s economic and geopolitical environ-ment because of the effect they have on U.S. domestic production. A nation s ability to produce domestically is the bedrock of its national and economic security. Both my first Administration in 2017, and the Biden Administration in 2022, recognized that increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security. According to 2023 United Nations data, U.S. manufacturing output as a share of global manufacturing output was 17.4 percent, down from a peak in 2001 of 28.4 percent. Over time, the persistent decline in U.S. manufacturing output has reduced U.S. manufacturing capacity. The need to maintain robust and resilient domestic manufacturing capacity is particularly acute in certain advanced industrial sectors like automobiles, shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, technology products, machine tools, and basic and fabricated metals, because once competitors gain sufficient global market share in these sectors, U.S. produc-tion could be permanently weakened. It is also critical to scale manufacturing capacity in the defense-industrial sector so that we can manufacture the defense materiel and equipment necessary to protect American interests at home and abroad. In fact, because the United States has supplied so much military equipment to other countries, U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be compatible with U.S. national defense interests. Furthermore, U.S. defense companies must develop new, advanced manufacturing technologies across a range of critical sectors including bio-manufacturing, batteries, and micro-electronics. If the United States wishes to maintain an effective security umbrella to defend its citizens and homeland, as well as for its allies and partners, it needs to have a large upstream manufacturing and goods- producing ecosystem to manufacture these products without undue reliance on imports for key inputs. Increased reliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised U.S. economic security by rendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geo-political disruption and supply shocks. In recent years, the vulnerability of the U.S. economy in this respect was exposed both during the COVID  19 pandemic, when Americans had difficulty accessing essential products, as well as when the Houthi rebels later began attacking cargo ships in the Middle East. The decline of U.S. manufacturing capacity threatens the U.S. economy in other ways, including through the loss of manufacturing jobs. From 1997 to 2024, the United States lost around 5 million manufacturing jobs and experienced one of the largest drops in manufacturing employment in history. Furthermore, many manufacturing job losses were concentrated in specific geographical areas. In these areas, the loss of manufacturing jobs contributed VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:04 Apr 04, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 07APE1.SGM 07APE1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC215044 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 65   Monday, April 7, 2025   Presidential Documents to the decline in rates of family formation and to the rise of other social trends, like the abuse of opioids, that have imposed profound costs on the U.S. economy. The future of American competitiveness depends on reversing these trends. Today, manufacturing represents just 11 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, yet it accounts for 35 percent of American productivity growth and 60 percent of our exports. Importantly, U.S. manufacturing is the main engine of innovation in the United States, responsible for 55 percent of all patents and 70 percent of all research and development (R D) spending. The fact that R D expenditures by U.S. multinational enterprises in China grew at an average rate of 13.6 percent a year between 2003 and 2017, while their R D expenditures in the United States grew by an average of just 5 percent per year during the same time period, is evidence of the strong link between manufacturing and innovation. Furthermore, every manufacturing job spurs 7 to 12 new jobs in other related industries, helping to build and sustain our economy. Just as a nation that does not produce manufactured products cannot maintain the industrial base it needs for national security, neither can a nation long survive if it cannot produce its own food. Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience), designates food and agriculture as a   critical infrastructure sector   because it is one of the sectors considered   so vital to the United States that  its  incapacity or destruction . . . would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combina-tion of those matters.   Furthermore, when I left office, the United States had a trade surplus in agricultural products, but today, that surplus has vanished. Eviscerated by a slew of new non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners, it has been replaced by a projected $49 billion annual agricultural trade deficit. For these reasons, I hereby declare and order: Section 1. National Emergency. As President of the United States, my highest duty is ensuring the national and economic security of the country and its citizens. I have declared a national emergency arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, which have grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024. This trade deficit reflects asymmetries in trade relationships that have contributed to the atrophy of domestic production capacity, especially that of the U.S. manufacturing and defense-industrial base. These asymmetries also impact U.S. producers  ability to export and, consequentially, their incentive to produce. Specifically, such asymmetry includes not only non-reciprocal differences in tariff rates among foreign trading partners, but also extensive use of non-tariff barriers by foreign trading partners, which reduce the competitive-ness of U.S. exports while artificially enhancing the competitiveness of their own goods. These non-tariff barriers include technical barriers to trade  non-scientific sanitary and phytosanitary rules  inadequate intellectual prop-erty protections  suppressed domestic consumption (e.g., wage suppression)  weak labor, environmental, and other regulatory standards and protections  and corruption. These non-tariff barriers give rise to significant imbalances even when the United States and a trading partner have comparable tariff rates. The cumulative effect of these imbalances has been the transfer of resources from domestic producers to foreign firms, reducing opportunities for domestic manufacturers to expand and, in turn, leading to lost manufacturing jobs, diminished manufacturing capacity, and an atrophied industrial base, includ-ing in the defense-industrial sector. At the same time, foreign firms are better positioned to scale production, reinvest in innovation, and compete VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:04 Apr 04, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 07APE1.SGM 07APE1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC215045 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 65   Monday, April 7, 2025   Presidential Documents in the global economy, to the detriment of U.S. economic and national security. The absence of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity in certain critical and advanced industrial sectors another outcome of the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits also compromises U.S. economic and na-tional security by rendering the U.S. economy less resilient to supply chain disruption. Finally, the large, persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, and the concomitant loss of industrial capacity, have compromised military readiness  this vulnerability can only be redressed through swift corrective action to rebalance the flow of imports into the United States. Such impact upon military readiness and our national security posture is especially acute with the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad. I call upon the public and private sector to make the efforts necessary to strengthen the international economic position of the United States. Sec. 2. Reciprocal Tariff Policy. It is the policy of the United States to rebalance global trade flows by imposing an additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners except as otherwise provided herein. The additional ad valorem duty on all imports from all trading partners shall start at 10 percent and shortly thereafter, the additional ad valorem duty shall increase for trading partners enumerated in Annex I to this order at the rates set forth in Annex I to this order. These additional ad valorem duties shall apply until such time as I determine that the underlying conditions described above are satisfied, resolved, or mitigated. Sec. 3. Implementation. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this order, all articles imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10 percent. Such rates of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, and entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided in this order, at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, all articles from trading partners enumerated in Annex I to this order imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to the country-specific ad valorem rates of duty specified in Annex I to this order. Such rates of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, except that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, and entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on April 9, 2025, shall not be subject to these country-specific ad valorem rates of duty set forth in Annex I to this order. These country-specific ad valorem rates of duty shall apply to all articles imported pursuant to the terms of all existing U.S. trade agreements, except as provided below. (b) The following goods as set forth in Annex II to this order, consistent with law, shall not be subject to the ad valorem rates of duty under this order: (i) all articles that are encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b)  (ii) all articles and derivatives of steel and aluminum subject to the duties imposed pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended, Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended, and Procla-mation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), as amended, Proclamation 10895 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:04 Apr 04, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 07APE1.SGM 07APE1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC215046 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 65   Monday, April 7, 2025   Presidential Documents Into the United States), and Proclamation 10896 of February 10, 2025 (Adjust- ing Imports of Steel into the United States)  (iii) all automobiles and auto-motive parts subject to the additional duties imposed pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, and proclaimed in Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States)  (iv) other products enumerated in Annex II to this order, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, certain critical minerals, and energy and energy products  (v) all articles from a trading partner subject to the rates set forth in Column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS)  and (vi) all articles that may become subject to duties pursuant to future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

(d) With respect to articles from Canada, I have imposed additional duties on certain goods to address a national emergency resulting from the flow of illicit drugs across our northern border pursuant to Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as amended by Executive Order 14197 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border), and Executive Order 14231 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border). With respect to articles from Mexico, I have imposed additional duties on certain goods to address a national emergency resulting from the flow of illicit drugs and illegal migration across our southern border pursuant to Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended by Executive Order 14198 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Southern Border), and Executive Order 14227 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Situa-tion at Our Southern Border). As a result of these border emergency tariff actions, all goods of Canada or Mexico under the terms of general note 11 to the HTSUS, including any treatment set forth in subchapter XXIII of chapter 98 and subchapter XXII of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as related to the Agreement between the United States of America, United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA), continue to be eligible to enter the U.S. market under these preferential terms. However, all goods of Canada or Mexico that do not qualify as originating under USMCA are presently subject to additional ad valorem duties of 25 percent, with energy or energy resources and potash imported from Canada and not qualifying as originating under USMCA presently subject to the lower additional ad valorem duty of 10 percent. (e) Any ad valorem rate of duty on articles imported from Canada or Mexico under the terms of this order shall not apply in addition to the ad valorem rate of duty specified by the existing orders described in sub-section (d) of this section. If such orders identified in subsection (d) of this section are terminated or suspended, all items of Canada and Mexico that qualify as originating under USMCA shall not be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty, while articles not qualifying as originating under USMCA shall be subject to an ad valorem rate of duty of 12 percent. However, these ad valorem rates of duty on articles imported from Canada and Mexico shall not apply to energy or energy resources, to potash, or to an article eligible for duty-free treatment under USMCA that is a part or component of an article substantially finished in the United States. (f) More generally, the ad valorem rates of duty set forth in this order shall apply only to the non-U.S. content of a subject article, provided at least 20 percent of the value of the subject article is U.S. originating.

Purpose. The United States has imposed tariffs under various statutory authorities and through a number of Executive Orders and proclama- tions to protect national security and address unusual and extraordinary threats to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Although each of these actions, as listed in section 2 of this order, serves separate and distinct policy purposes, I have now determined that, to the extent these tariffs apply to the same article, these tariffs should not all have a cumulative effect (or   stack   on top of one another) because the rate of duty resulting from such stacking exceeds what is necessary to achieve the intended policy goals. To avoid the cumulative effect of overlapping tariffs on certain articles, this order sets out the procedure for determining which of multiple tariffs shall apply to an article when that article is subject to more than one of the actions listed in section 2 of this order. Sec. 2. Applicability. This order shall apply only to the administration of tariffs imposed through the following actions and subsequent amendments to those tariffs: (a) Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Auto- mobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States)  (b) Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as amended by Executive Order 14197 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border), Executive Order 14226 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), and Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border)  (c) Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended by Executive Order 14198 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Southern Border), Executive Order 14227 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address the Situation at Our Southern Border), and Executive Order 14232 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Southern Border)  (d) Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended by Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), and Proclamation 10895 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States)  and (e) Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended by Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel VerDate Sep 11 2014 16:30 May 01, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 02MYE3.SGM 02MYE3khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC618908 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 84   Friday, May 2, 2025   Presidential Documents Articles Into the United States), and Proclamation 10896 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States). Sec. 3. Non-Stacking of Tariff Measures. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of any action listed in section 2 of this order, tariffs for articles subject to tariffs under the actions listed in section 2 of this order shall apply as follows: (i) An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the action listed in section (2)(a) of this order shall not be subject to additional tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in sections 2(b) through 2(e) of this order. (ii) An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(b) or 2(c) of this order shall not be subject to additional tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(d) or 2(e) of this order. (iii) An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(d) of this order shall be subject to additional tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(e) of this order, provided the article otherwise satisfies all conditions necessary for application of those additional tariffs  likewise, an article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(e) of this order shall be subject to additional tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(d) of this order, provided the article otherwise satisfies all conditions necessary for application of those additional tariffs. (b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not be construed to diminish the validity of any action listed in section 2 of this order. Each action listed in section 2 of this order remains independently valid and enforceable, except that the duty rates provided by these actions shall not be cumulative when the conditions outlined in subsection (a) of this section are met.

Sec. 4. Non-applicability to Other Tariff Measures. (a) Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to alter or limit the application of any duties, taxes, fees, or exactions other than those imposed pursuant to the actions listed in section 2 of this order. (b) Accordingly, an article that is subject to duties pursuant to an action listed in section 2 of this order may still be subject to other applicable duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges, such as, but not limited to, those set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS)  duties imposed pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended  duties imposed pursuant to Executive Order 14195 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People s Republic of China), as amended  and anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Sec. 5. Implementation. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall take all necessary steps to update guidance, systems, and enforcement mechanisms, including to revise, suspend, or rescind any regulations that may be inconsistent with this order, to reflect the policy set forth in this order. (b) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative, shall provide additional guidance as necessary to en-sure consistent interpretation and application of the policy set forth in this order.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel-come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restric-tion on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Canada on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by alu-minum imports from Canada. In particular, the United States agreed on a range of measures with Canada that were expected to allow imports of aluminum from Canada to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary s report. These included measures to monitor for and avoid import surges. 4. In light of this agreement, I determined that, under the framework in the agreement, imports of aluminum from Canada would no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I decided to exclude Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. I noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, and that I may revisit this determination as appropriate. 5. In Proclamation 9704, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Sec-retary s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:38 Aug 13, 2020 Jkt 250250 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 14AUD0.SGM 14AUD0khammond on DSKJM1Z7X2PROD with PRESDOC49922 Federal Register   Vol. 85, No. 158   Friday, August 14, 2020   Presidential Documents 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports. 6. The Secretary has now advised me that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, which accounted for 59 percent of total aluminum imports from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020, increased substan-tially in the twelve months following my decision to exclude, on a long- term basis, Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020 increased 87 percent compared to the prior twelve-month period and exceeded the volume of any full calendar year in the previous decade. Moreover, imports of these articles from Canada continue to increase, reach-ing in June of this year the highest level of any month since I decided to adjust imports of aluminum articles in Proclamation 9704. The increase in imports of these articles from Canada is principally responsible for the 27 percent increase in total aluminum imports from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020. 7. Canada is the largest source of United States imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum, accounting for nearly two-thirds of total imports of these articles from all countries in 2019 and approximately 75 percent of total imports in the first five months of 2020. The surge in imports of these articles from Canada coincides with a decrease in imports of these articles from other countries and threatens to harm domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization. 8. In light of the Secretary s information, I have determined that the measures agreed upon with Canada are not providing an effective alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security from imports of aluminum from Canada. Thus, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to re-impose the 10 percent ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada, commensurate with the tariff imposed on such articles imported from most countries. 9. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, including with respect to imports of other aluminum articles. In particular, the United States will monitor for import surges of articles that continue to be exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclama-tion 9704, to ensure that exports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum to the United States are not simply reoriented into increased exports of alloyed, further processed, or wrought aluminum articles. 10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting   and   before   (d)   and inserting before the period at the end:   , (e) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, and Mexico  and (f) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:38 Aug 13, 2020 Jkt 250250 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 14AUD0.SGM 14AUD0khammond on DSKJM1Z7X2PROD with PRESDOC49923 Federal Register   Vol. 85, No. 158   Friday, August 14, 2020   Presidential Documents 16, 2020, from Canada, except with respect to imports of non-alloyed un- wrought aluminum provided for in subheading 7601.10, which shall be subject to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty  .

(4) Any exclusion of aluminum articles from Canada granted by the Sec- retary of Commerce pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, that has not expired shall be valid under the modifications to the HTSUS made by this proclamation.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel-come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restric-tion on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Canada on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by alu-minum imports from Canada. In particular, the United States agreed on a range of measures with Canada that were expected to allow imports of aluminum from Canada to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary s report. These included measures to monitor for and avoid import surges. 4. In light of this agreement, I determined that, under the framework in the agreement established with Canada, imports of aluminum from Canada would no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I decided to exclude Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. I noted that the United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, and that I may revisit this determination as appropriate. 5. In Proclamation 10060 of August 6, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that imports of non-alloyed unwrought VerDate Sep 11 2014 16:05 Oct 29, 2020 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 30OCD0.SGM 30OCD0jbell on DSKJLSW7X2PROD with PRESDOC068710 Federal Register   Vol. 85, No. 211   Friday, October 30, 2020   Presidential Documents aluminum from Canada had increased substantially following my decision to exclude, on a long-term basis, Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. I further noted that this surge in imports coincided with a decrease in imports of these articles from other countries and threat-ened to harm domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization. In light of these circumstances, I determined that it was necessary and appro-priate to re-impose the 10 percent ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclama-tion 9704, as amended, on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada. 6. The United States has held consultations with Canada regarding exports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada to the United States. On the basis of these consultations, the United States expects that exports of these articles from Canada to the United States will decrease significantly in the remaining months of 2020, from a monthly average of approximately 154,000 metric tons in the first 7 months of this year to a monthly average of approximately 77,000 tons in September through December. This 50 per-cent decrease in the volume would reduce United States imports of non- alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada to a level below the average of monthly imports of these articles from Canada in any calendar year in the past decade, thus alleviating the threatened harm to domestic alu-minum production and capacity utilization posed by the previous surge in imports of these articles. 7. In light of these changed circumstances, and in view of the measures previously agreed upon with Canada to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada, as de-scribed in Proclamation 9893, I have determined that imports of aluminum from Canada will no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I have decided to reinstate Canada s exclusion from the tariff on these articles proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. As specified in this proclamation, I may re-impose the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada in the event that the volume of imports of these articles from Canada in the remaining months of 2020 exceeds the quantities that the United States expects will be exported from Canada to the United States during this period. The United States and Canada expect to hold further consultations in December 2020 to discuss the state of aluminum trade between the two countries in light of trade patterns in the last 4 months of 2020 and expected market conditions in 2021. 8. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, as described in Proclamation 9893, both with respect to imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum and imports of other alu-minum articles. 9. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: VerDate Sep 11 2014 16:05 Oct 29, 2020 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 30OCD0.SGM 30OCD0jbell on DSKJLSW7X2PROD with PRESDOC068711 Federal Register   Vol. 85, No. 211   Friday, October 30, 2020   Presidential Documents (1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting   and   before   (f)   and inserting before the period at the end:   , and (g) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico.  .

In the event that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada exceed 105 percent of the volumes set forth below for any month, I will consider re-imposing the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of these articles from Canada, which may include retroactive application to articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020. The volumes are: 83,000,000 kilograms for September 2020  70,000,000 kilograms for October 2020  83,000,000 kilograms for November 2020  and 70,000,000 kilograms for December 2020. In the event that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada exceed 105 percent of the volumes above for any month, I may consider whether the volume stipulated for the fol-lowing month is reduced by the amount of the excess in making my deter-mination whether to re-impose the tariff. I may also consider re-imposing the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of these articles from Canada based on the outcome of consultations between the United States and Canada in December 2020 and expected market conditions in 2021. (4) The modifications made by clause 1 of this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.

Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada provided for in subheading 7601.10, admitted into a United States foreign trade zone before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, under   privileged foreign status   as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, shall remain subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amend-ed. (6) In the event that I decide, as described in clause 3 of this proclamation, to re-impose the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of non- alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, including possible retroactive application of the tariff, no drawback shall be available with respect to such duties imposed.

I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel-come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. I also noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restric-tion on aluminum article imports from that country and, if necessary, make corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. The United States has an important security relationship with the United Arab Emirates, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns in the Middle East, particularly in countering Iran s malign influence there  combatting violent extremism around the world  and maintaining the strong economic ties between our countries. 4. In light of the foregoing, the United States has engaged in discussions with the United Arab Emirates on alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates. On the basis of these discussions, the United States and the United Arab Emirates have now agreed on satisfactory alter-native means to address this threat. 5. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with the United Arab Emirates on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from the United Arab Emirates, specifically a quota restricting the quantity of alu-minum articles imported into the United States from the United Arab Emir-ates. This measure is expected to allow imports of aluminum from the United Arab Emirates to remain close to historical levels without meaningful increases, thus making it more likely that domestic capacity utilization will VerDate Sep 11 2014 16:10 Jan 22, 2021 Jkt 253001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 25JAD0.SGM 25JAD0jbell on DSKJLSW7X2PROD with PRESDOC06826 Federal Register   Vol. 86, No. 14   Monday, January 25, 2021   Presidential Documents be reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Sec- retary s report. In my judgment, this measure will provide effective, long- term alternative means to address the contribution of the United Arab Emir-ates to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining aluminum article exports from the United Arab Emirates to the United States, limiting export surges by the United Arab Emirates, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of this agreement, I have determined that aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude the United Arab Emirates from the tariff pro-claimed in Proclamation 9704. The United States will monitor the implemen-tation and effectiveness of the measure agreed with the United Arab Emirates in addressing our national security needs, and this determination may be revisited, as appropriate. 6. In light of my determination to exclude the United Arab Emirates from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon measure with the United Arab Emirates, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 7.

Proclamation 10139 of January 19, 2021 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), amended Proclamation 9704 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended, with respect to tariffs on certain imports of aluminum articles proclaimed under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). Proclamation 10139 provides that those amendments will not take effect until 12:01 a.m. on February 3, 2021. 2. I consider it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to maintain, at this time, the tariff treatment applied to aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) under Proclamation 9704, as amended, as they are currently in effect as of this date. Accordingly, and as provided for in clause (6) of Proclamation 10139, I am terminating the modifications contained in that proclamation before they take effect. 3. Proclamation 9704 applied tariffs to help ensure the economic viability of the domestic aluminum industry an industry that the Secretary of Com-merce had previously identified as essential to our critical industries and national defense. Because robust domestic aluminum production capacity is essential to meet our current and future national security needs, Proclama-tion 9704 aimed to revive idled aluminum facilities, open closed smelters and mills, preserve necessary skills, and maintain or increase domestic production by reducing United States reliance on foreign producers. 4. In my view, the available evidence indicates that imports from the UAE may still displace domestic production, and thereby threaten to impair our national security. Proclamation 9704 authorized the Secretary of Commerce to grant exclusions from the aluminum tariffs based on specific national security considerations or if specific imported aluminum articles were deter-mined not to be produced sufficiently in the United States, such that the imports would not diminish domestic production. Tellingly, there have been 33 such exclusion requests for aluminum imported from the UAE, covering 587,007 metric tons of articles, and the Secretary of Commerce has denied 32 of those requests, covering 582,007 metric tons. This indicates the large degree of overlap between imports from the UAE and what our domestic industry is capable of producing. 5. Since the tariff on aluminum imports was imposed, such imports substan- tially decreased, including a 25 percent reduction from the UAE, and domes-tic aluminum production increased by 22 percent through 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary s investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Proclamation 9704 further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel-come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted the continuing discussions with the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national secu-rity by aluminum articles imported from the EU. Recognizing that the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, the President determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 2018. In Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted that, unless the President determines by further proclama-tion that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU, the tariff pro-claimed in Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries. 4.

The United States and the EU have agreed to expand coordination involving trade remedies and customs matters, mon-itor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market excess capacity, and annually review their arrangement and their ongoing cooperation. In addition, the United States and the EU will seek to conclude, by October 31, 2023, negotiations on global steel and aluminum arrangements to restore market-oriented conditions and support the reduction of carbon intensity of steel and aluminum across modes of production. 5. The United States will implement a number of actions, including a tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of aluminum articles imported into the United States from the EU without the application of the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. Under the arrangement, aluminum articles that area accompanied by a certificate of analysis are eligible for in-quota treatment. In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long- term alternative means to address any contribution by EU aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment to the national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from the EU, limiting trans-shipment, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production. In light of this agreement, I have determined that specified volumes of eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from the EU up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 through December 31, 2023. The United States will monitor the imple-mentation and effectiveness of the tariff-rate quota and other measures agreed upon with the EU in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate. 6. The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, align with the recommendations specified in the Secretary s report assessing the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232. The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume, total-ing 18,000 metric tons of unwrought aluminum and 366,040 metric tons of semi-finished wrought aluminum, is consistent with the objective of reach-ing and sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic aluminum industry. 7. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 8. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

The United States has successfully concluded discussions with the United Kingdom (UK) on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imports from the UK. The United States and the UK have agreed to expand coordina-tion involving trade remedies and customs matters, monitor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market excess capacity and carbon intensity in these sectors, annually review their arrangement and their ongoing cooperation, and confer on market-distorting influence or ownership in the steel and aluminum industries.

Under the arrangement, aluminum articles, except semi-finished wrought aluminum articles, that are accompanied by a certificate of analysis are eligible for in-quota treatment.

In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by UK aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from the UK, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of this agreement, I have determined that specified volumes of eligible aluminum articles imports from the UK will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from the UK up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the tariff-rate quota and other meas-ures agreed upon with the UK in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate. 5. The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, are consistent with the recommendations specified in the original investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume, totaling 900 metric tons of unwrought aluminum, 11,400 metric tons of semi-finished wrought alu-minum other than foil, and 9,300 metric tons of foil, is consistent with the objective of reaching and sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic aluminum industry. 6. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from the UK, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) To establish a tariff-rate quota on imports of eligible aluminum articles from the UK as set forth in paragraph 4 of this proclamation, U.S. Note 19 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended as provided for in the Annex to this proclamation. Imports of aluminum articles from the UK in excess of the tariff-rate quota quantities shall remain subject to the duties imposed by clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended. The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall recommend to the President, as warranted, updates to the in-quota volumes contained in the Annex to this proclamation. Aluminum articles from the UK imported under an exclusion granted pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, shall count against the in-quota volume of the tariff-rate quota established in clause 1 of this proclamation. (2) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting   and   before   (h)   and inserting before the period at the end:   , and (i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight VerDate Sep 11 2014 15:52 Jun 02, 2022 Jkt 256001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 03JND0.SGM 03JND0khammond on DSKJM1Z7X2PROD with PRESDOC33585 Federal Register   Vol. 87, No. 107   Friday, June 3, 2022   Presidential Documents time on June 1, 2022, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and from the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, and from the United Kingdom, for aluminum articles covered by headings 9903.85.25 through 9903.85.44, inclusive.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary s investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. 3. In Proclamation 9704, the President also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform the President of any circumstances that in the Secretary s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports. 4. The Secretary has informed me that the capacity utilization in the domestic aluminum industry remains well below the target capacity utilization level recommended in the January 2018 report. The Secretary has also informed me that two of the five remaining aluminum smelters in the United States are in danger of closing as a result of continued high levels of aluminum imports and high energy prices. 5. In the Secretary s January 2018 report, the Secretary recommended that the President consider applying a higher tariff to a list of specific countries should the President determine that all countries should not be subject to the same tariff. One of the countries on that list was the Russian Federation (Russia). As the Secretary explained in that report, Russia is among the major exporters of aluminum to the United States for domestic consumption. While aluminum imports from Russia have declined from the volume in the Secretary s 2018 report, Russia remains the fifth largest source of imported aluminum in the United States, and the imports of aluminum from Russia have increased in both 2021 and 2022. Distortions that result from over-capacity threaten market-oriented aluminum industries and Russia s alu-minum industry in particular is extremely export oriented, with Russia being the largest exporter of unwrought aluminum in 2021 and Russian domestic consumption accounting for just 22 percent of Russian production across 2021 and 2022. United States imports of Russian aluminum increased by 53 percent between March and July 2022. 6. Russia continues its unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscion- able war against Ukraine. The Russian aluminum industry is a key part of Russia s defense industrial base and has played a major role in supplying Russia with weapons and ammunition used in the war. In addition, Russia s VerDate Sep 11 2014 20:00 Mar 01, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 02MRD0.SGM 02MRD0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-D013268 Federal Register   Vol. 88, No. 41   Thursday, March 2, 2023   Presidential Documents war against Ukraine has caused global energy prices to rise, causing direct harm to the United States aluminum industry. 7. To further reduce imports of aluminum articles and increase domestic capacity utilization, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to impose: (a) beginning on March 10, 2023, a 200 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles that are the product of Russia and derivative aluminum articles that are the product of Russia  and (b) beginning on April 10, 2023, a 200 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the aluminum articles are cast in Russia, and derivative aluminum articles where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the derivative aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the derivative aluminum articles are cast in Russia. (c)   Primary aluminum   is defined as new aluminum metal that is pro- duced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-Heroult process. 8. The Secretary has advised me that the tariff adjustment described in paragraph 7 of this proclamation will be a significant step toward ensuring the viability of the domestic aluminum industry. 9. In adopting the tariff adjustment described in paragraph 7 of this proclama- tion, I recognize that concerns about aluminum imports from Russia and their impact on our national security are shared by other countries, and that we need to work together with our partners to ensure that the global market distortions caused by Russian aluminum articles do not distort our markets and threaten our national security. Any country that imposes a tariff of 200 percent or more on its imports of aluminum articles that are products of Russia may be exempt from the tariff imposed by this proclamation. 10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of aluminum articles that are the product of Russia, or where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the aluminum articles are cast in Russia, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary s investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles (aluminum articles), by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Proclamation 9704 further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted the continuing discussions with the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national secu-rity by aluminum articles imported from the EU. Recognizing that the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, the President determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 2018. In Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted that, unless the President determines by further proclama-tion that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU, the tariff pro-claimed in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries. 4. In Proclamation 10327 of December 27, 2021 (Adjusting Imports of Alu- minum Into the United States), I noted that the United States successfully concluded discussions with the EU on behalf of the EU s member countries VerDate Sep 11 2014 15:42 Jan 02, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 03JAD0.SGM 03JAD0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-D0224 Federal Register   Vol. 89, No. 2   Wednesday, January 3, 2024   Presidential Documents on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum articles imports from the EU. The United States and the EU agreed to expand coordination involving trade remedies and customs matters, monitor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market excess capacity, and annually review their arrangement and their ongoing cooperation. In addition, the United States and the EU agreed to seek to conclude, by October 31, 2023, negotiations on global steel and aluminum arrangements to restore market- oriented conditions and support the reduction of carbon intensity of steel and aluminum across modes of production. 5. Pursuant to the agreement described in Proclamation 10327, the United States implemented a number of actions, including a tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of aluminum articles imported into the United States from the EU without the application of the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. I concluded that these measures provide an effective, long-term alter-native means to address any contribution by EU aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment to the national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from the EU, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production. In light of this agreement, I also determined that specified volumes of eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU no longer threaten to impair the national security and decided to exclude such imports from the EU up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 through December 31, 2023. I also found that the agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume, totaling 18,000 metric tons of unwrought aluminum and 366,040 metric tons of semi-finished wrought aluminum, is consistent with the objective of reaching and sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domes-tic aluminum industry. 6. During the past 2 years, the United States and the EU have made substantial progress to identify the sources of non-market excess capacity and the actions needed to address distortions resulting from that non-market excess capacity. The United States and the EU are continuing their discussions on global steel and aluminum arrangements to restore market-oriented conditions in their steel and aluminum sectors and support the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of steel and aluminum across all modes of production. These discussions are anticipated to include alternative measures to prevent imports of aluminum from the EU from threatening the national security of the United States. 7. In light of the ongoing discussions and joint actions pursuant to the agreement described in Proclamation 10327, I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU is to continue the discussions and joint actions with the EU and to extend the tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of aluminum articles imported into the United States from the EU without the application of the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. In order to be eligible for in- quota treatment, all imports of aluminum articles from the EU must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis. In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribu-tion by EU aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment of the national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from the EU, limiting transshipment, discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production, and strengthening the United States-EU partnership in a fashion that will better enable future arrangements. 8. In light of the ongoing discussions and joint actions taken pursuant to the agreement described in Proclamation 10327, I have determined that specified volumes of eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from the EU up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 through December 31, 2025.

The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, align with the recommendations specified in the original investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume specified in the 2021 agree-ment between the United States and the EU, totaling 18,000 metric tons of unwrought aluminum and 366,040 metric tons of semi-finished wrought aluminum, remains consistent with the objective of reaching and sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic aluminum industry. 10. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclama- tion 9704 as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 11. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 12. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting   and   before   (j)   and inserting before the period at the end:   , and (k) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on March 10, 2023, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and from the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2025, from the United Kingdom, for aluminum articles covered by headings 9903.85.25 through 9903.85.44, inclusive, and from Russia.

In Proclamation 9704, the President also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform the President of any circumstances that in the Secretary s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports. 4. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted that the United States had successfully concluded discussions with Mexico on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Mexico. The United States agreed on a range of measures with Mexico that were expected to allow imports of aluminum from Mexico to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful in-creases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reason-ably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary s report. In the President s judgment, these measures would provide effective, long-term alternative means to address the contribution of Mexico s imports to the threatened impairment of the national security. 5. The President determined in Proclamation 9893 that, under the framework in the agreement reached with Mexico, imports of aluminum from Mexico would no longer threaten to impair the national security and accordingly VerDate Sep 11 2014 15:51 Jul 12, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 15JYD0.SGM 15JYD0ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with PRESDOC-D057340 Federal Register   Vol. 89, No. 135   Monday, July 15, 2024   Presidential Documents excluded Mexico from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amend- ed. The President noted that the United States would monitor the implemen-tation and effectiveness of these measures in addressing our national security needs, and that the President may revisit this determination as appropriate. 6. In Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), the President noted that, among other things, imports of certain derivatives of aluminum articles had significantly increased since the imposition of tariffs and quotas on imports of aluminum articles in 2018. The President further noted the Secretary s assessment that foreign producers increased shipments of such derivative articles to the United States to circumvent the duties on aluminum articles imposed in Proclamation 9704 and that the net effect of the increase of imports of these derivatives had been to erode the customer base for United States producers of aluminum and undermine the purpose of Proclamation 9704. 7. Based on such assessments by the Secretary, the President concluded in Proclamation 9980 that it was necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to adjust the tariffs imposed by previous proclamations to apply to certain derivatives of aluminum articles from most countries, excluding Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Mexico. This action was necessary and appropriate to address circumvention that was undermining the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Procla-mation 9704, as amended, and to remove the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States found in that proclamation. 8. The Secretary has informed me that domestic aluminum producers  capac- ity utilization remains below the target 80 percent capacity utilization rec-ommended in the Secretary s report of January 19, 2018, and imports of aluminum articles from Mexico have increased significantly as compared to their levels at the time of Proclamation 9893. Furthermore, Mexico lacks primary aluminum smelting capabilities, and the country of smelt or country of most recent cast is unknown for a significant volume of aluminum imports from Mexico. In the Secretary s opinion, these developments indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such aluminum imports. In monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the agreement with Mexico in ad-dressing our national security needs, I have determined that it is appropriate to revisit the President s determination in Proclamation 9893 regarding the applicability of the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704 to aluminum articles imports from Mexico. 9. Accordingly, the United States will implement a country of smelt and country of most recent cast requirement for imports of aluminum articles that are products of Mexico, and will increase the section 232 duty rate for imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico containing aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran. In order to be eligible for importation free from section 232 tariffs, aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis and must not contain primary aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran. In my judg-ment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by Mexican aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment of the national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from Mexico, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Mexico in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.

To prevent transshipment, excess production, or other actions that would lead to increased exports of aluminum articles to the United States, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary, shall advise me if there is a surge in imports of aluminum articles to the United States from Mexico and on the appropriate means to ensure that such imports from Mexico do not undermine the national security objectives of the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. If necessary and appropriate, I will consider directing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security to no longer exclude imports of aluminum articles from Mexico from the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. 12. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclama- tion 9704, as amended, as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from Mexico, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjust-ments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 13. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) To establish a country of smelt and country of most recent cast require- ment for imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Mexico, and an increase in the duty rate for imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles that are products of Mexico con-taining aluminum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, or country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to paragraph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran, amendments to U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 and new HTSUS headings are provided for in the Annex to this proclamation.

(2) Aluminum articles eligible for treatment under clause 1 of this procla- mation must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis in order to receive such treatment. Eligible aluminum articles must not contain primary alu-minum for which the reported primary country of smelt, secondary country of smelt, and country of most recent cast is China, Russia (subject to para-graph 10 of this proclamation), Belarus, or Iran.   Primary country of smelt   is defined as the country where the largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall- He roult process.   Secondary country of smelt   is the country where the second largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-He  roult process.   Country of most recent cast   refers to the country where the aluminum (with or without alloying elements) was last liquified by heat and cast into a solid state. The final solid state can take the form of either a semi-finished product (slab, billets or ingots) or a finished aluminum product. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to take such actions as are nec-essary to ensure compliance with this requirement. Failure to comply could result in applicable remedies or penalties under United States law. (3) For purposes of implementing this and other proclamations, importers shall provide to CBP the information necessary to identify the countries where the primary aluminum used in the manufacture of aluminum articles imports covered by clause 1 of Proclamation 9704 are smelted and informa-tion necessary to identify the countries where such aluminum articles imports are cast. CBP shall implement the smelt and cast information requirements as soon as practicable. (4) The modifications to the HTSUS made by clause 1 of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or with-drawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. (5) Any imports of aluminum articles that are products of Mexico and that were admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under   privileged foreign status   as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, shall be subject upon entry for consumption made on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July 10, 2024, to the provisions of Proclamation 9893, Proclamation 9980, and Proclamation 10522 (for im-ports containing aluminum smelt or cast in Russia). (6) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232). The Secretary found and advised me of the Secretary s opinion that aluminum is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum was being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. Proclamation 9704 further stated that any country with which the United States has a security relationship is welcome to discuss alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9704, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Sec-retary s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 with respect to such imports. Pursuant to Proclamation 9704, the Sec-retary was authorized to provide relief from the additional duties, based on a request from a directly affected party located in the United States, for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality, or based upon specific national security considerations. Proclamation 9776 of August 29, 2018, and Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020, simi-larly authorized the Secretary to provide relief from certain tariffs on other aluminum products and derivatives set forth in those proclamations. 4. In subsequent proclamations, the President adjusted the tariffs applicable to aluminum articles imports from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and the United Kingdom (UK), after engaging in discussions with each of those parties on alternative ways to address the threat to the national security from such imports. 5. The Secretary has informed me that, notwithstanding the 10 percent ad valorem tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 that mitigated the threatened impairment of our national security, aluminum imports into the United States have continued at unacceptable levels as the global aluminum excess capacity crisis continues. In addition, the exclusion of certain countries VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:00 Feb 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 18FED0.SGM 18FED0lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC09808 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 31   Tuesday, February 18, 2025   Presidential Documents and products from the tariff and efforts by foreign producers to circumvent the tariff have undermined the purpose of Proclamation 9704, which was to adjust the level of imports of aluminum to remove the threatened impair-ment of the national security. This has again resulted in aluminum smelter capacity utilization rates in the domestic aluminum industry that are well below the target level recommended in the Secretary s January 19, 2018, report. This indicates that the initial tariff of 10 percent ad valorem is not high enough to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum imports. 6. In particular, the Secretary has informed me that global primary aluminum capacity has continued to increase, fueled by expansions in the People s Republic of China (China) and South America, which is seen in rising aluminum imports that continue to weigh on the price domestic aluminum producers may charge. There has also been a significant increase in Chinese investment in Mexico, driven by massive Chinese government subsidies and the continued ability to exploit loopholes in U.S. trade policy. 7. Domestic aluminum producers have been forced to idle additional produc- tion and shut down facilities. Two primary aluminum smelters within the United States have closed since Proclamation 9704 was promulgated. In addition, U.S. primary aluminum production decreased by 30 percent from 2020 to 2024, and U.S. smelter capacity utilization was only 52 percent in 2024. Overcapacity for primary aluminum has harmed downstream alu-minum producers, including producers of aluminum extrusions and alu-minum sheet. To allow U.S. aluminum producers to restart production and to incentivize new capacity, additional adjustments to section 232 tariffs on aluminum need to be made, including limiting exemptions and increasing the tariff rate. 8. The Secretary has informed me that imports of aluminum articles from countries that are excluded from the tariff regime or have alternative arrange-ments have remained significantly elevated at levels that once again threaten to impair the national security of the United States. The volume of U.S. imports of aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the UK in 2024 was approximately 14 percent higher than the average volume of such imports in 2015 through 2017. In particular, the volume of U.S. imports of primary aluminum from Canada in 2024 was approximately 18 percent higher than the average volume for 2015 through 2017. Notwithstanding Proclamation 10782 of July 10, 2024, which imposed higher tariffs on certain aluminum imports from Mexico, imports of aluminum from Mexico have continued to surge beyond historical vol-umes. The volume of U.S. imports of aluminum articles from Mexico in 2024 was approximately 35 percent higher than the average volume for 2015 through 2017. Proclamation 10782 did not resolve the surge of imports of aluminum from Mexico. Mexican producers are using unfair trade to gain market share in the United States and are leveraging their access to unfairly traded global primary aluminum to do so. I understand that Mexican producers are commingling primary aluminum from China and the Russian Federation (Russia) with primary aluminum from other countries to produce downstream aluminum articles. These practices are distortive and provide continued outlets to absorb the massive amount of global excess capacity and must be remedied. The volume of U.S. imports of primary aluminum from Australia has also surged and in 2024 was approximately 103 percent higher than the average volume for 2015 through 2017. Australia has dis-regarded its verbal commitment to voluntarily restrain its aluminum exports to a reasonable level. 9. These volume increases occurred even though demand for aluminum in the United States and Canada (the market measured by industry) has generally remained flat, averaging about 20 percent since 2018. 10. These increasing import volumes support the conclusion that aluminum producers in countries subject to the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 are engaging in transshipment or further processing VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:00 Feb 14, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 18FED0.SGM 18FED0lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC09809 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 31   Tuesday, February 18, 2025   Presidential Documents of upstream aluminum products in countries that have since been exempted from that tariff. Foreign producers have shifted assembly or manufacturing operations to third countries, such as Mexico. For example, Chinese pro-ducers are using Mexico s general exclusion from the tariff to funnel Chinese aluminum to the United States through Mexico while avoiding the tariff. 11. The Secretary has informed me that producers in countries that remain subject to the ad valorem tariff have continued to evade the tariff by proc-essing covered aluminum articles into additional downstream derivative products that were not included in the additional ad valorem tariffs pro-claimed in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9980. Foreign producers are continuing to expand downstream production to absorb the global excess capacity. Imports of additional derivative aluminum products have increased significantly since the issuance of Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9980, eroding the domestic industry s customer base and resulting in depressed demand for aluminum articles produced in the United States. 12. The Secretary has also informed me of the impact of the product exclusion process authorized by Proclamation 9704, Proclamation 9776, and Proclama-tion 9980 and implemented by subsequent regulations. This process has resulted in exclusions for a significant volume of imports, in a manner that undermines the purpose of the section 232 measures and threatens to impair the national security of the United States. Certain general approved exclusions remain in effect for entire tariff lines of aluminum imports, notwithstanding the domestic industry s potential to produce many excluded products. 13. I determine that these developments and modifications to the original tariff regime as proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 have undermined the re-gime s national security objectives by preventing the domestic aluminum industry (including derivatives) from achieving sustained production capacity utilization of at least 80 percent, as determined in the Secretary s January 19, 2018, report. I also determine that the modifications failed to achieve their articulated objectives. As a result, I determine that these modifications have resulted in significantly increasing imports of aluminum articles that once again threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 14. In light of the Secretary s findings, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to adjust the tariff proclaimed by Proclamation 9704, as amended, and the tariff proclaimed by Proclamation 9980, as amended, to increase the tariff rate from 10 percent ad valorem to 25 percent ad valorem. These actions are necessary and appropriate to remove the threat-ened impairment of the national security of the United States. 15. In light of the Secretary s findings regarding the alternative agreements with Argentina proclaimed in Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018  Australia proclaimed in Proclamation 9758  Canada proclaimed in Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019, and Proclamation 10106 of October 27, 2020  Mexico proclaimed in Proclamation 9893 and Proclamation 10782 of July 10, 2024  the European Union proclaimed in Proclamation 10327 of December 27, 2021, and Proclamation 10690 of December 28, 2023  and the United King-dom proclaimed in Proclamation 10405 of May 31, 2022, I have decided that it is necessary to terminate these agreements as of March 12, 2025. As of March 12, 2025, all imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the UK shall be subject to the additional ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, with respect to aluminum articles and Proclamation 9980, as amended, with respect to derivative aluminum articles. Imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Argen-tina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, EU countries, and the UK shall be subject to the revised tariff rate of 25 percent ad valorem established in clause 2 of this proclamation, commensurate with the tariff rate imposed on such articles imported from most other countries.

Replacing the alternative agreements with the additional ad valorem tariffs will be a more robust and effective means of ensuring that the objectives articulated in the Secretary s January 19, 2018, report and subsequent proclamations are achieved. 16. In light of the information provided by the Secretary that the significant increase of imports of certain derivative aluminum articles has depressed demand for aluminum articles produced by domestic aluminum producers, I have determined that it is necessary to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9980 to apply to additional derivative aluminum articles. 17. I have also determined that it is necessary to terminate the product exclusion process as authorized in clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, clause 1 of Proclamation 9776, and clause 2 of Proclamation 9980. 18. Section 232, as amended, authorizes the President to take action to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 19. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

In addition to inclusions made by the Secretary, this process shall provide for including additional derivative aluminum articles at the request of a producer of an aluminum article or derivative aluminum article within the United States, or an industry association representing one or more such producers, establishing that imports of a derivative aluminum article have increased in a manner that threatens to impair the national security or otherwise undermine the objectives set forth in the Secretary s January 19, 2018 report or any Proclamation issued pursuant thereto.

On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on the Secretary s investigation into the effect of imports of steel mill articles (steel articles) on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that steel articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), and Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), I concurred with the Secretary s findings that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, and derivative steel articles, as described in clause 3 of Proclamation 9980, are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and I decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles and derivative steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. In Proclamation 10896 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Im-ports of Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust the imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries. 3. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary transmitted to me a report on the Secretary s investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232. The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such cir-cumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 4. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), and Proclamation 9980, I concurred with the Sec-retary s findings that aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclama-tion 9704, and derivative aluminum articles, as described in clause 3 of Proclamation 9980, are being imported into the United States in such quan-tities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valo- rem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. In Proclamation 10895 of February 10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries. 5. In Proclamation 10896 and Proclamation 10895, I instructed the Secretary to continue to monitor imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles, and aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles, respectively, and VerDate Sep 11 2014 15:37 Jun 06, 2025 Jkt 265001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 09JND0.SGM 09JND0khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PRESDOC24200 Federal Register   Vol. 90, No. 109   Monday, June 9, 2025   Presidential Documents to review the status of such imports with respect to the national security of the United States. The Secretary has done so and has advised me accord-ingly. 6. After considering current information newly provided by the Secretary, among other things, I have determined that it is necessary to increase the previously described steel and aluminum tariffs to adjust the imports of steel and aluminum articles and their derivative articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. In my judgment, the in-creased tariffs will more effectively counter foreign countries that continue to offload low-priced, excess steel and aluminum in the United States market and thereby undercut the competitiveness of the United States steel and aluminum industries. Although the previously imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have helped provide critical price support in the United States market, they have not yet enabled these industries to develop and maintain the rates of capacity production utilization that are necessary for the industries  sustained health and for projected national defense needs. I have determined that increasing the previously imposed tariffs will provide greater support to these industries and reduce or eliminate the national security threat posed by imports of steel and aluminum articles and their derivative articles. 7. Accordingly, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to increase the tariff rate for imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles, and aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles, from 25 percent ad valorem to 50 percent ad valorem effective as of 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 4, 2025. I have also determined that it is necessary and appropriate to modify the way in which the tariff measures described in Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025 (Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles), apply to steel articles and derivative steel articles, and aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles, to ensure the effectiveness of the tariff changes described in this proclamation and the alignment of policy priorities between this proclamation and Executive Order 14289. I have further determined that it is necessary and appropriate to allow for the implementation of the U.S.-UK Economic Prosperity Deal of May 8, 2025 (EPD), and to accordingly provide different treatment, as described below, for imports of steel and aluminum articles, and their deriva-tives, from the United Kingdom. 8. Section 232 authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232  the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)  section 301 of title 3, United States Code  and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) As set forth in Annexes I and II to this proclamation, as of 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 4, 2025, the tariffs proclaimed by Proclama-tion 9704, as amended  Proclamation 9705, as amended  Proclamation 9980, as amended  Proclamation 10895  and Proclamation 10896 are modified to increase the respective tariff rates from an additional 25 percent ad valorem to an additional 50 percent ad valorem.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 2. The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. The Secretary found that the present quantities of aluminum imports and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing aluminum are   weakening our internal economy,   leaving the United States   almost totally reliant on foreign producers of primary aluminum   and   at risk of becoming completely reliant on foreign producers of high-purity aluminum that is essential for key military and commercial systems.   Because of these risks, and the risk that the domestic aluminum industry would become   unable to satisfy existing national security needs or respond to a national security emergency that requires a large increase in domestic production,   and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary con- cluded that the present quantities and circumstances of aluminum imports threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. 3. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended actions to adjust the imports of aluminum so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. Among those recommendations was a global tariff of 7.7 percent on imports of aluminum articles in order to reduce imports to a level that the Secretary assessed would enable domestic aluminum producers to use approximately 80 percent of existing domestic production capacity and thereby achieve long-term economic viability through increased production. The Secretary has also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient U.S. production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude aluminum articles from such restric-tions for specific national security-based considerations. 4. I concur in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such cir-cumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and I have considered his recommendations. 5. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of acts affecting import treatment, VerDate Sep 11 2014 19:15 Mar 14, 2018 Jkt 244001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 15MRD0.SGM 15MRD0sradovich on DSK3GMQ082PROD with PRES DOCS11620 Federal Register   Vol. 83, No. 51   Thursday, March 15, 2018   Presidential Documents and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 7. In the exercise of these authorities, I have decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles, as defined below, imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. In my judgment, this tariff is necessary and appropriate in light of the many factors I have considered, including the Secretary s report, updated import and production numbers for 2017, the failure of countries to agree on measures to reduce global excess capacity, the continued high level of imports since the beginning of the year, and special circumstances that exist with respect to Canada and Mexico. This relief will help our domestic aluminum industry to revive idled facilities, open closed smelters and mills, preserve necessary skills by hiring new aluminum workers, and maintain or increase production, which will reduce our Nation s need to rely on foreign producers for aluminum and ensure that domestic producers can continue to supply all the aluminum necessary for critical industries and national defense. Under current circumstances, this tariff is necessary and appropriate to address the threat that imports of aluminum articles pose to the national security. 8. In adopting this tariff, I recognize that our Nation has important security relationships with some countries whose exports of aluminum to the United States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten to impair the national security. I also recognize our shared concern about global excess capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened impairment of the national security. Any country with which we have a security relation-ship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. Should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as our national security interests require. 9. I conclude that Canada and Mexico present a special case. Given our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns, our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity for producing aluminum, the physical proximity of our respective industrial bases, the robust economic integration between our countries, the export of aluminum produced in the United States to Canada and Mexico, and the close relation of the economic welfare of the United States to our national security, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from Canada and Mexico is to continue ongoing discussions with these countries and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. I expect that Canada and Mexico will take action to prevent transshipment of alu-minum articles through Canada and Mexico to the United States. 10. In the meantime, the tariff imposed by this proclamation is an important first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic aluminum industry. Without this tariff and satisfactory outcomes in ongoing negotiations with Canada and Mexico, the industry will continue to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of alu-minum to meet our national security needs a situation that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the American people. It is my judgment that the tariff imposed by this proclamation is necessary and appropriate to adjust imports of aluminum articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.

(2) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of aluminum articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclama-tion, all imports of aluminum articles specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum articles from all countries except Canada and Mexico.

Such relief shall be provided for an aluminum article only after a request for exclusion is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. If the Secretary determines that a particular aluminum article should be excluded, the Sec-retary shall, upon publishing a notice of such determination in the Federal Register, notify Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 2 of this proclamation. The Secretary shall consult with CBP to determine whether the HTSUS provisions created by the Annex to this proclamation should be modified in order to ensure the proper administration of such exclusion, and, if so, shall make such modification to the HTSUS through a notice in the Federal Register. (4) Within 10 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary shall issue procedures for the requests for exclusion described in clause 3 of this proclamation.

Each of these countries has an important security relationship with the United States and I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports from aluminum articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. Any country not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports of aluminum articles from that country. 5.

The United States has an important security relationship with the EU and its constituent member countries, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in national security concerns  the strong economic and strategic partnership between the United States and the EU, and between the United States and EU member countries  and our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production. 10. In light of the foregoing, I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries is to continue ongoing discussions and to increase strategic partnerships, including those with re-spect to reducing global excess capacity in aluminum production by address-ing its root causes. In my judgment, discussions regarding measures to reduce excess aluminum production and excess aluminum capacity, measures that will increase domestic capacity utilization, and other satisfactory alter- native means will be most productive if the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 on aluminum articles imports from these countries is removed at this time. 11. However, the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 remains an important first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic aluminum industry and removing the threatened impairment of the national security. Without this tariff and the adoption of satisfactory alternative means address-ing long-term solutions in ongoing discussions with the countries listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation, the industry will continue to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of aluminum to meet our national security needs a situation that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the Amer-ican people. As a result, unless I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from a particular country listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 shall be effective May 1, 2018, for the countries listed as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation.

Because the current tariff exemptions are temporary, however, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to maintain the current tariff level at this time. 12. In the meantime, to prevent transshipment, excess production, or other actions that would lead to increased exports of aluminum articles to the United States, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall advise me on the appropriate means to ensure that imports from countries exempt from the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704 do not undermine the national security objectives of such tariff. If necessary and appropriate, I will consider directing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security to implement a quota as soon as prac-ticable, and will take into account all aluminum articles imports since January 1, 2018, in setting the amount of such quota. 13. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 14.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require. 3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federa-tive Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member coun-tries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from those countries. Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, I determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 2018. 4. The United States has agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impair-ment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imported from these countries. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil is to extend the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, in order to finalize the details of these satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imported from these countries.

Because the United States has agreed in principle with these countries, in my judg-ment, it is unnecessary to set an expiration date for the exemptions. Neverthe-less, if the satisfactory alternative means are not finalized shortly, I will consider re-imposing the tariff. 5. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada, Mexico, and the EU. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to extend the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, at least at this time. In my judgment, and for the reasons I stated in paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9710, these discussions will be most productive if aluminum articles from these countries remain exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. 6. For the reasons I stated in paragraph 11 of Proclamation 9710, however, the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 remains an important first step in ensuring the economic stability of our domestic aluminum industry and removing the threatened impairment of the national security. As a result, unless I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries. 7. I have determined that, in light of the ongoing discussions that may result in long-term exclusions from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 8. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 9.

In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federa-tive Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member coun-tries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from those countries. Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, I determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, until May 1, 2018. 4. In Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I noted that the United States had agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by alu-minum articles imports from these countries and extended the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, in order to finalize the details. 5. The United States has agreed on a range of measures with Argentina and Australia, including measures to reduce excess aluminum production and excess aluminum capacity, measures that will contribute to increased VerDate Sep 11 2014 15:54 Jun 04, 2018 Jkt 244001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 05JND0.SGM 05JND0amozie on DSK3GDR082PROD with PRES DOCS25850 Federal Register   Vol. 83, No. 108   Tuesday, June 5, 2018   Presidential Documents capacity utilization in the United States, and measures to prevent the trans- shipment of aluminum articles and avoid import surges. In my judgment, these measures will provide effective, long-term alternative means to address these countries  contribution to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining aluminum articles exports to the United States from each of them, limiting transshipment and surges, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of these agree-ments, I have determined that aluminum articles imports from these countries will no longer threaten to impair the national security and thus have decided to exclude these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. The United States will monitor the implementation and effec-tiveness of the measures agreed upon with these countries to address our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate. 6. In light of my determination to exclude, on a long-term basis, these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon measures with these countries, and the fact that the tariff will now apply to imports of aluminum articles from additional countries, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences:   Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all aluminum articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consump-tion, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union, (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the European Union, and (c) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina and Australia. This rate of duty, which is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum articles from each country as specified in the preceding sentence.  . (2) In order to implement a quota treatment on aluminum articles imports from Argentina, U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended as provided for in Part A of the Annex to this proclamation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security shall implement this quota as soon as practicable, taking into account all aluminum articles imports from this country since January 1, 2018.

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended action to adjust the imports of aluminum articles so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security. The Secretary also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude alu-minum articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of these aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further authorized the Secretary to provide relief from these additional duties for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfac-tory quality and also to provide such relief based on specific national security considerations. 3. Consistent with the Secretary s recommendation that I authorize him to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic production of comparable products, or for specific national security-based considerations, I have determined to authorize the Secretary to provide relief from quantitative limitations on aluminum articles adopted pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, including those set forth in Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), on the same basis as the Secretary is currently authorized to provide relief from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704. 4. In light of my determinations, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff or quotas imposed by previous procla-mations. It is my judgment that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff and quota levels.

The United States continues to hold discussions with countries on satisfac- tory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imports. Should these discussions result in an agreement concerning such alternative means, I will take further action as appropriate. 6. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representa-tive (USTR), the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby authorized to provide relief from the quantitative limitations applicable to aluminum articles described in subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for any aluminum article deter-mined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality, and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations. Such relief shall be provided for an aluminum article only after a request for relief is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. Such relief may be provided to directly affected parties on a party-by- party basis taking into account the regional availability of particular articles, the ability to transport articles within the United States, and any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate. If the Secretary determines that relief should be granted to a requesting party for the importation of a particular aluminum article, the Secretary shall publicly post such determina-tion and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the applicable quantitative limitation. Relief granted under this clause shall apply only to an article entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date on which the request for relief is granted by the Secretary. Until such time as any applicable quantitative limitation for a particular article has been reached, CBP shall count any aluminum article for which relief is granted under this clause toward such quantitative limitation at the time when such aluminum article is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. Any aluminum article for which relief is granted under this clause shall not be subject to the additional rate of duty set forth in Proclamation 9704, as amended. Aluminum articles for which relief is granted under this clause shall be subject to the duty treatment provided in subheading 9903.85.11 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as established by the Annex to this proclamation.

(3) Clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by Proclamation 9710, is further amended by striking the fourth and fifth sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following two sentences:   If the Secretary determines that a particular aluminum article should be excluded, the Secretary shall publicly post such determination and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protec-tion (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 2 of this proclamation. For merchandise entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date the duty established under this proclamation is effective and with respect to which liquidation is not final, such relief shall be retroactive to the date the request for relief was accepted by the Department of Commerce.  . (4) Where the government of a country identified in the superior text to subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS notifies the United States that it has established a mechanism for the certification of exports to the United States of products covered by the quantitative limitations applicable to these subheadings, and where such mechanism meets the operational requirements for participation in an export certification system administered by the United States, CBP, in consultation with the Secretary, USTR, and other relevant executive depart-ments and agencies, may require that importers of these products furnish relevant export certification information in order to qualify for the treatment set forth in subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06. Where CBP adopts such a requirement, it shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the requirement and procedures for the submission of relevant export certification information. No article that is subject to the export certification requirement announced in such notice may be entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective date specified in such notice, except upon presentation of a valid and properly executed certification, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the notice. (5) Subdivision (c) of U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by inserting at the end the following new sentence:   Pursuant to subheading 9903.85.11 and superior text thereto, the Secretary may provide that any excluded product shall be granted entry into the customs territory of the United States when the applicable quantitative limita-tion has filled for the specified period for such good.  . (6) Subdivision (d) of U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended by inserting after   9903.85.06   the phrase   and 9903.85.11  .

On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s finding that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. 3. In Proclamation 9704, I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require. 4. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with Canada and Mexico on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened im-pairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico. The United States has agreed on a range of measures with Canada and Mexico to prevent the importation of aluminum that is unfairly subsidized or sold at dumped prices, to prevent the transshipment of alu-minum, and to monitor for and avoid import surges. These measures are expected to allow imports of aluminum from Canada and Mexico to remain stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary s report. In my judgment, these measures will provide effective, long-term alternative means to address the contribution of these countries  imports to the threatened impairment of the national security. 5. In light of these agreements, I have determined that, under the framework in the agreements, imports of aluminum from Canada and Mexico will no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I have decided to exclude Canada and Mexico from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of these measures in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination as appropriate.

In light of my determination to exclude, on a long-term basis, these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon measures with Canada and Mexico, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel articles on the national security of the United States, and on January 19, 2018, the Secretary transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States. Both reports were issued pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expan-sion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), and Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary s findings that aluminum articles and steel articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. I therefore decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. I also decided to adjust the imports of steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. 3. In Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I decided to further adjust imports of aluminum articles by imposing quotas on such articles from the Argentine Republic (Argentina). In Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust imports of steel articles by imposing quotas on such articles from the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and in Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust imports of steel articles by imposing quotas on such articles from Argentina and the Republic of Brazil (Brazil). 4. In Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, I directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and steel articles, respectively, and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. 5. The Secretary has informed me that domestic steel producers  capacity utilization has not stabilized for an extended period of time at or above the 80 percent capacity utilization level identified in his report as necessary to remove the threatened impairment of the national security. Stabilizing at that level is important to provide the industry with a reasonable expecta-tion that market conditions will prevail long enough to justify the investment necessary to ramp up production to a sustainable and profitable level. Capac-ity utilization in the aluminum industry has improved, but it is still below the target capacity utilization that the Secretary recommended in his report. Although imports of aluminum articles and steel articles have declined VerDate Sep 11 2014 18:39 Jan 28, 2020 Jkt 250001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4705 Sfmt 4790 E: FR FM 29JAD0.SGM 29JAD0lotter on DSKBCFDHB2PROD with FR_PRESDOCS5282 Federal Register   Vol. 85, No. 19   Wednesday, January 29, 2020   Presidential Documents since the imposition of the tariffs and quotas, the Secretary has informed me that imports of certain derivatives of aluminum articles and imports of certain derivatives of steel articles have significantly increased since the imposition of the tariffs and quotas. The net effect of the increase of imports of these derivatives has been to erode the customer base for U.S. producers of aluminum and steel and undermine the purpose of the proclamations adjusting imports of aluminum and steel articles to remove the threatened impairment of the national security. 6. The derivative articles the Secretary identified are described in Annex I (aluminum) and Annex II (steel) to this proclamation. For purposes of this proclamation, the Secretary determined that an article is   derivative   of an aluminum article or steel article if all of the following conditions are present: (a) the aluminum article or steel article represents, on average, two-thirds or more of the total cost of materials of the derivative article  (b) import volumes of such derivative article increased year-to-year since June 1, 2018, following the imposition of the tariffs in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended by Proclamation 9739 and Proclamation 9740, respectively, in comparison to import volumes of such derivative article during the 2 preceding years  and (c) import volumes of such derivative article following the imposition of the tariffs exceeded the 4 percent average increase in the total volume of goods imported into the United States during the same period since June 1, 2018. The modifications to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States de-scribed in Annex I (aluminum) and Annex II (steel) to this proclamation implement the Secretary s determinations in this regard. 7. From June 2018 to May 2019, import volumes of steel nails, tacks, drawing pins, corrugated nails, staples, and similar derivative articles increased by 33 percent, compared to June 2017 to May 2018, and increased by 29 percent, compared to June 2016 to May 2017. From January 2019 to November 2019, import volumes of such articles increased by 23 percent, compared to the same period in 2017. Similarly, from June 2018 to May 2019, import volumes of aluminum stranded wire, cables, plaited bands, and the like (including slings and similar derivative articles) increased by 152 percent, compared to June 2017 to May 2018, and increased by 52 percent, compared to June 2016 to May 2017. From January 2019 to November 2019, import volumes of such articles increased by 127 percent, compared to the same period in 2017. Finally, from June 2018 to May 2019, import volumes of bumper and body stampings of aluminum and steel for motor vehicles and tractors increased by 38 percent, compared to June 2017 to May 2018, and increased by 56 percent, compared to June 2016 to May 2017. From January 2019 to November 2019, import volumes of such articles increased by 37 percent, compared to the same period in 2017. 8. It is the Secretary s assessment that foreign producers of these derivative articles have increased shipments of such articles to the United States to circumvent the duties on aluminum articles and steel articles imposed in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, and that imports of these deriva-tive articles threaten to undermine the actions taken to address the risk to the national security of the United States found in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705. As detailed in the Secretary s reports, domestic production capacity to produce aluminum articles and steel articles for national defense and critical infrastructure is essential to United States na-tional security. This domestic production capacity is used to provide the essential inputs of aluminum and steel used in derivative aluminum articles and derivative steel articles. The Secretary has assessed that reducing imports of the derivative articles described in Annex I and Annex II to this proclama-tion would reduce circumvention and facilitate the adjustment of imports that Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended, made to increase domestic capacity utilization to address the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States.

Based on the Secretary s assessments, I have concluded that it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to adjust the tariffs imposed by previous proclamations to apply to the derivatives of aluminum articles and steel articles described in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation. This action is necessary and appropriate to address circumvention that is undermining the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended, and to remove the threatened impairment of the national security of the United States found in those proclamations. 10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States. 11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat-ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu-ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows: (1) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of certain derivative articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation. Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of derivative aluminum articles specified in Annex I to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty, and all imports of derivative steel articles specified in Annex II to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty, with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2020. These rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), Canada, and the United Mexican States (Mexico) and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea. The Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of the derivative articles described in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation, and shall, from time to time, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative (USTR), review the status of such imports with respect to the national security of the United States. In the event of a surge of imports of any derivative article described in Annex I or Annex II to this proclamation from any excepted country, the Secretary, with the concurrence of the USTR, is authorized to extend application of the tariff imposed by this proclamation on imports of any derivative article experiencing such surge from such country, or to adopt appropriate quotas for imports of such derivative article from such country, or to negotiate a voluntary agreement with such country to ensure that imports of such derivative article from such country do not undermine the effectiveness of the adjustment of imports made in Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, as amended. The Secretary shall publish such action in the Federal Register and notification shall be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security.

Such relief shall be provided for a derivative article only after a request for exclusion is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. If the Secretary determines that a particular derivative article should be excluded, the Secretary shall publicly post such determination and notify CBP concerning such article so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 1 of this proclamation. For merchandise entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date the duty established under this proclama-tion is effective and with respect to which liquidation is not final, such relief shall be retroactive to the date the request for relief was accepted by the Department of Commerce.

(4) Derivative articles shall not be subject upon entry for consumption to the duty established in clause 1 of this proclamation merely by reason of manufacture in a U.S. foreign trade zone. However, derivative articles admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone in   privileged foreign status   pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation shall retain that status consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e).

(6) The Secretary, in consultation with CBP and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Sec-retary shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the Federal Register.
