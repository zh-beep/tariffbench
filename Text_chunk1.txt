Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the 
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 
2. The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum is 
being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United 
States. The Secretary found that the present quantities of aluminum imports 
and the circumstances of global excess capacity for producing aluminum 
are ‘‘weakening our internal economy,’’ leaving the United States ‘‘almost 
totally reliant on foreign producers of primary aluminum’’ and ‘‘at risk 
of becoming completely reliant on foreign producers of high-purity aluminum 
that is essential for key military and commercial systems.’’ Because of these 
risks, and the risk that the domestic aluminum industry would become 
‘‘unable to satisfy existing national security needs or respond to a national 
security emergency that requires a large increase in domestic production,’’ 
and taking into account the close relation of the economic welfare of the 
Nation to our national security, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), the Secretary con cluded that the present quantities and circumstances of aluminum imports 
threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 of the 
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. 
3. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended actions to adjust 
the imports of aluminum so that such imports will not threaten to impair 
the national security. Among those recommendations was a global tariff 
of 7.7 percent on imports of aluminum articles in order to reduce imports 
to a level that the Secretary assessed would enable domestic aluminum 
producers to use approximately 80 percent of existing domestic production 
capacity and thereby achieve long-term economic viability through increased 
production. The Secretary has also recommended that I authorize him, in 
response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude 
from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles for which 
the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient U.S. production capacity 
of comparable products, or to exclude aluminum articles from such restric tions for specific national security-based considerations. 
4. I concur in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum articles are being 
imported into the United States in such quantities and under such cir cumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United 
States, and I have considered his recommendations. 
5. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of acts affecting import treatment,

11620 Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 51 / Thursday, March 15, 2018 / Presidential Documents 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, 
or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
7. In the exercise of these authorities, I have decided to adjust the imports 
of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum 
articles, as defined below, imported from all countries except Canada and 
Mexico. In my judgment, this tariff is necessary and appropriate in light 
of the many factors I have considered, including the Secretary’s report, 
updated import and production numbers for 2017, the failure of countries 
to agree on measures to reduce global excess capacity, the continued high 
level of imports since the beginning of the year, and special circumstances 
that exist with respect to Canada and Mexico. This relief will help our 
domestic aluminum industry to revive idled facilities, open closed smelters 
and mills, preserve necessary skills by hiring new aluminum workers, and 
maintain or increase production, which will reduce our Nation’s need to 
rely on foreign producers for aluminum and ensure that domestic producers 
can continue to supply all the aluminum necessary for critical industries 
and national defense. Under current circumstances, this tariff is necessary 
and appropriate to address the threat that imports of aluminum articles 
pose to the national security. 
8. In adopting this tariff, I recognize that our Nation has important security 
relationships with some countries whose exports of aluminum to the United 
States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten to impair the 
national security. I also recognize our shared concern about global excess 
capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened impairment 
of the national security. Any country with which we have a security relation ship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address 
the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from 
that country. Should the United States and any such country arrive at 
a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security 
such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten 
to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction 
on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make 
any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries 
as our national security interests require. 
9. I conclude that Canada and Mexico present a special case. Given our 
shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security 
concerns, our shared commitment to addressing global excess capacity for 
producing aluminum, the physical proximity of our respective industrial 
bases, the robust economic integration between our countries, the export 
of aluminum produced in the United States to Canada and Mexico, and 
the close relation of the economic welfare of the United States to our 
national security, see 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), I have determined that the necessary 
and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed 
by imports of aluminum articles from Canada and Mexico is to continue 
ongoing discussions with these countries and to exempt aluminum articles 
imports from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. I expect 
that Canada and Mexico will take action to prevent transshipment of alu minum articles through Canada and Mexico to the United States. 
10. In the meantime, the tariff imposed by this proclamation is an important 
first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic aluminum 
industry. Without this tariff and satisfactory outcomes in ongoing negotiations 
with Canada and Mexico, the industry will continue to decline, leaving 
the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign producers of alu minum to meet our national security needs—a situation that is fundamentally 
inconsistent with the safety and security of the American people. It is 
my judgment that the tariff imposed by this proclamation is necessary and 
appropriate to adjust imports of aluminum articles so that such imports 
will not threaten to impair the national security as defined in section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, 
and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, do 
hereby proclaim as follows: 
(1) For the purposes of this proclamation, ‘‘aluminum articles’’ are defined 
in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as: (a) unwrought aluminum (HTS 
7601); (b) aluminum bars, rods, and profiles (HTS 7604); (c) aluminum 
wire (HTS 7605); (d) aluminum plate, sheet, strip, and foil (flat rolled 
products) (HTS 7606 and 7607); (e) aluminum tubes and pipes and tube 
and pipe fitting (HTS 7608 and 7609); and (f) aluminum castings and forgings 
(HTS 7616.99.51.60 and 7616.99.51.70), including any subsequent revisions 
to these HTS classifications. 
(2) In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of aluminum 
articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided 
in the Annex to this proclamation. Except as otherwise provided in this 
proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclama tion, all imports of aluminum articles specified in the Annex shall be subject 
to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 
a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018. This rate of duty, which 
is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable 
to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum 
articles from all countries except Canada and Mexico. 
(3) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary

2 of this proclamation for any aluminum article determined not to be pro duced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount 
or of a satisfactory quality and is also authorized to provide such relief 
based upon specific national security considerations. Such relief shall be 
provided for an aluminum article only after a request for exclusion is made 
by a directly affected party located in the United States. If the Secretary 
determines that a particular aluminum article should be excluded, the Sec retary shall, upon publishing a notice of such determination in the Federal 
Register, notify Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department 
of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded 
from the duties described in clause 2 of this proclamation. The Secretary 
shall consult with CBP to determine whether the HTSUS provisions created 
by the Annex to this proclamation should be modified in order to ensure 
the proper administration of such exclusion, and, if so, shall make such 
modification to the HTSUS through a notice in the Federal Register. 
(4) Within 10 days after the date of this proclamation, the Secretary shall 
issue procedures for the requests for exclusion described in clause 3 of 
this proclamation. The issuance of such procedures is exempt from Executive 
Order 13771 of January 30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regu latory Costs). 
(5) (a) The modifications to the HTSUS made by the Annex to this proclama tion shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on March 23, 2018, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are 
expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.

Federal Register / Vol. 90, No. 84 / Friday, May 2, 2025 / Presidential Documents 18907 
Executive Order 14289 of April 29, 2025 
Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported Articles 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, 
as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), and section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, it is hereby ordered: 
Section 1. Purpose. The United States has imposed tariffs under various 
statutory authorities and through a number of Executive Orders and proclama tions to protect national security and address unusual and extraordinary 
threats to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States. Although each of these actions, as listed in section 2 of this order, 
serves separate and distinct policy purposes, I have now determined that, 
to the extent these tariffs apply to the same article, these tariffs should 
not all have a cumulative effect (or ‘‘stack’’ on top of one another) because 
the rate of duty resulting from such stacking exceeds what is necessary 
to achieve the intended policy goals. To avoid the cumulative effect of 
overlapping tariffs on certain articles, this order sets out the procedure 
for determining which of multiple tariffs shall apply to an article when 
that article is subject to more than one of the actions listed in section 
2 of this order. 
Sec. 2. Applicability. This order shall apply only to the administration 
of tariffs imposed through the following actions and subsequent amendments 
to those tariffs: 
(a) Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Auto mobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States); 
(b) Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address 
the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), as amended by 
Executive Order 14197 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at 
Our Northern Border), Executive Order 14226 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment 
to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border), 
and Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties to 
Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border); 
(c) Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address 
the Situation at Our Southern Border), as amended by Executive Order 
14198 of February 3, 2025 (Progress on the Situation at Our Southern Border), 
Executive Order 14227 of March 2, 2025 (Amendment to Duties To Address 
the Situation at Our Southern Border), and Executive Order 14232 of March 
6, 2025 (Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across 
Our Southern Border); 
(d) Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), as amended by Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 
2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative 
Steel Articles Into the United States), and Proclamation 10895 of February 
10, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States); and 
(e) Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into 
the United States), as amended by Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020

2025 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States). 
Sec. 3. Non-Stacking of Tariff Measures. (a) Notwithstanding any provision 
of any action listed in section 2 of this order, tariffs for articles subject 
to tariffs under the actions listed in section 2 of this order shall apply 
as follows: 
(i) An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the action listed in section 
(2)(a) of this order shall not be subject to additional tariffs on that article 
pursuant to the actions listed in sections 2(b) through 2(e) of this order. 
(ii) An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions listed in section 
2(b) or 2(c) of this order shall not be subject to additional tariffs on 
that article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(d) or 2(e) of this 
order. 
(iii) An article subject to tariffs pursuant to the actions listed in section 
2(d) of this order shall be subject to additional tariffs on that article 
pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(e) of this order, provided the 
article otherwise satisfies all conditions necessary for application of those 
additional tariffs; likewise, an article subject to tariffs pursuant to the 
actions listed in section 2(e) of this order shall be subject to additional 
tariffs on that article pursuant to the actions listed in section 2(d) of 
this order, provided the article otherwise satisfies all conditions necessary 
for application of those additional tariffs. 
(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not be construed to diminish the 
validity of any action listed in section 2 of this order. Each action listed 
in section 2 of this order remains independently valid and enforceable, 
except that the duty rates provided by these actions shall not be cumulative 
when the conditions outlined in subsection (a) of this section are met. 
(c) If an imported article is subject to both a tariff imposed pursuant 
to subsection (a) of this section and one or more tariffs imposed pursuant 
to an action or actions not listed in section 2 of this order, then the tariff 
imposed on the article pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be 
cumulative with the tariff or tariffs imposed pursuant to the action or actions 
not listed in section 2 of this order. 
Sec. 4. Non-applicability to Other Tariff Measures. (a) Nothing in this order 
shall be interpreted to alter or limit the application of any duties, taxes, 
fees, or exactions other than those imposed pursuant to the actions listed 
in section 2 of this order. 
(b) Accordingly, an article that is subject to duties pursuant to an action 
listed in section 2 of this order may still be subject to other applicable 
duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges, such as, but not limited to, those 
set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTSUS); duties imposed pursuant to section 301 of the Trade Act 
of 1974, as amended; duties imposed pursuant to Executive Order 14195 
of February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid 
Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China), as amended; and anti dumping and countervailing duties. 
Sec. 5. Implementation. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, acting 
through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall take all necessary 
steps to update guidance, systems, and enforcement mechanisms, including 
to revise, suspend, or rescind any regulations that may be inconsistent 
with this order, to reflect the policy set forth in this order. 
(b) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States 
Trade Representative, shall provide additional guidance as necessary to en sure consistent interpretation and application of the policy set forth in 
this order. 
(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to determine whether 
changes to the HTSUS are necessary and to coordinate with the Chair

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704 (aluminum articles), by imposing 
a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries 
except Canada and Mexico. 
3. In proclaiming this tariff, I recognized that our Nation has important 
security relationships with some countries whose exports of aluminum arti cles to the United States weaken our internal economy and thereby threaten 
to impair the national security. I also recognized our shared concern about 
global excess capacity, a circumstance that is contributing to the threatened 
impairment of the national security. I further determined that any country 
with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with 
the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment 
of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted 
that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory 
alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that 
I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair 
the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum 
articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as 
it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United 
States require. 
4. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada and Mexico, 
as well as the following countries, on satisfactory alternative means to address 
the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum 
articles from those countries: the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), 
the Argentine Republic (Argentina), the Republic of Korea (South Korea), 
the Federative Republic of Brazil (Brazil), and the European Union (EU) 
on behalf of its member countries. Each of these countries has an important 
security relationship with the United States and I have determined that 
the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national 
security posed by imports from aluminum articles from these countries 
is to continue these discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports 
from these countries from the tariff, at least at this time. Any country 
not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship 
remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to 
address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports 
of aluminum articles from that country. 
5. The United States has an important security relationship with Australia, 
including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing

national security concerns, particularly through our security, defense, and 
intelligence partnership; the strong economic and strategic partnership be tween our countries; our shared commitment to addressing global excess 
capacity in aluminum production; and the integration of Australian persons 
and organizations into the national technology and industrial base of the 
United States. 
6. The United States has an important security relationship with Argentina, 
including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing 
national security concerns in Latin America, particularly the threat posed 
by instability in Venezuela; our shared commitment to addressing global 
excess capacity in aluminum production; the reciprocal investment in our 
respective industrial bases; and the strong economic integration between 
our countries. 
7. The United States has an important security relationship with South 
Korea, including our shared commitment to eliminating the North Korean 
nuclear threat; our decades-old military alliance; our shared commitment 
to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production; and our strong 
economic and strategic partnership. 
8. The United States has an important security relationship with Brazil, 
including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing 
national security concerns in Latin America; our shared commitment to 
addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production; the reciprocal 
investment in our respective industrial bases; and the strong economic inte gration between our countries. 
9. The United States has an important security relationship with the EU 
and its constituent member countries, including our shared commitment 
to supporting each other in national security concerns; the strong economic 
and strategic partnership between the United States and the EU, and between 
the United States and EU member countries; and our shared commitment 
to addressing global excess capacity in aluminum production. 
10. In light of the foregoing, I have determined that the necessary and 
appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by 
imports of aluminum articles from these countries is to continue ongoing 
discussions and to increase strategic partnerships, including those with re spect to reducing global excess capacity in aluminum production by address ing its root causes. In my judgment, discussions regarding measures to 
reduce excess aluminum production and excess aluminum capacity, measures 
that will increase domestic capacity utilization, and other satisfactory alter native means will be most productive if the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704 on aluminum articles imports from these countries is removed at 
this time. 
11. However, the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 remains an important 
first step in ensuring the economic viability of our domestic aluminum 
industry and removing the threatened impairment of the national security. 
Without this tariff and the adoption of satisfactory alternative means address ing long-term solutions in ongoing discussions with the countries listed 
as excepted in clause 1 of this proclamation, the industry will continue 
to decline, leaving the United States at risk of becoming reliant on foreign 
producers of aluminum to meet our national security needs—a situation 
that is fundamentally inconsistent with the safety and security of the Amer ican people. As a result, unless I determine by further proclamation that 
the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove 
the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum 
articles from a particular country listed as excepted in clause 1 of this 
proclamation, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 shall 
be effective May 1, 2018, for the countries listed as excepted in clause 
1 of this proclamation. In the event that a satisfactory alternative means 
is reached such that I decide to exclude on a long-term basis a particular 
country from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, I will also consider 
whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security

interests to make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff set forth in 
clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 as it applies to other countries. Because 
the current tariff exemptions are temporary, however, I have determined 
that it is necessary and appropriate to maintain the current tariff level 
at this time. 
12. In the meantime, to prevent transshipment, excess production, or other 
actions that would lead to increased exports of aluminum articles to the 
United States, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with 
the Secretary and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall 
advise me on the appropriate means to ensure that imports from countries 
exempt from the tariff imposed in Proclamation 9704 do not undermine 
the national security objectives of such tariff. If necessary and appropriate, 
I will consider directing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the 
Department of Homeland Security to implement a quota as soon as prac ticable, and will take into account all aluminum articles imports since 
January 1, 2018, in setting the amount of such quota. 
13. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) Imports of all aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 
9704, from the countries listed in this clause shall be exempt from the 
duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 until 12:01 a.m. eastern 
daylight time on May 1, 2018. Further, clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 is 
amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting the following 
two sentences: ‘‘Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in 
notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all aluminum 
articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 
10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered, or with drawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on or after 12:01 
a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except 
Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil, and the member 
countries of the European Union, and (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern 
daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries. This rate of duty, which 
is in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable 
to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum 
articles from each country as specified in the preceding sentence.’’. 
(2) Paragraph (a) of U.S. note 19, added to subchapter III of chapter 
99 of the HTSUS by the Annex to Proclamation 9704, is amended by 
replacing ‘‘Canada and of Mexico’’ with ‘‘Canada, of Mexico, of Australia, 
of Argentina, of South Korea, of Brazil, and of the member countries of 
the European Union’’. 
(3) The ‘‘Article description’’ for heading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS is 
amended by replacing ‘‘Canada or of Mexico’’ with ‘‘Canada, of Mexico, 
of Australia, of Argentina, of South Korea, of Brazil, or of the member 
countries of the European Union’’.

and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any ad valorem rates 
of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading. 
Any aluminum article that was admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, as amended (aluminum articles), 
by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from 
most countries, beginning March 23, 2018. I further stated that any country 
with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with 
the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment 
of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted 
that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory 
alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that 
I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair 
the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum 
articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as 
it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United 
States require. 
3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine 
Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federa tive Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea 
(South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member coun tries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment 
to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from those 
countries. Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an 
important security relationship with the United States, I determined that 
the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to national security 
posed by imports of aluminum articles from these countries was to continue 
the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from 
these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, 
until May 1, 2018. 
4. In Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I noted that the United States had agreed in principle 
with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to 
address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by alu minum articles imports from these countries and extended the temporary 
exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704, as amended, in order to finalize the details. 
5. The United States has agreed on a range of measures with Argentina 
and Australia, including measures to reduce excess aluminum production 
and excess aluminum capacity, measures that will contribute to increased

capacity utilization in the United States, and measures to prevent the trans shipment of aluminum articles and avoid import surges. In my judgment, 
these measures will provide effective, long-term alternative means to address 
these countries’ contribution to the threatened impairment to our national 
security by restraining aluminum articles exports to the United States from 
each of them, limiting transshipment and surges, and discouraging excess 
aluminum capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of these agree ments, I have determined that aluminum articles imports from these countries 
will no longer threaten to impair the national security and thus have decided 
to exclude these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, 
as amended. The United States will monitor the implementation and effec tiveness of the measures agreed upon with these countries to address our 
national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate. 
6. In light of my determination to exclude, on a long-term basis, these 
countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, 
I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our 
national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such 
tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of 
the agreed-upon measures with these countries, and the fact that the tariff 
will now apply to imports of aluminum articles from additional countries, 
it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff 
level as it applies to other countries. 
7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended by 
striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following 
two sentences: ‘‘Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in 
notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all aluminum 
articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject to an additional 
10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consump tion, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (a) on 
or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries 
except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the 
member countries of the European Union, (b) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern 
daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the European Union, 
and (c) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from 
all countries except Argentina and Australia. This rate of duty, which is 
in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable 
to such imported aluminum articles, shall apply to imports of aluminum 
articles from each country as specified in the preceding sentence.’’. 
(2) In order to implement a quota treatment on aluminum articles imports 
from Argentina, U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS 
is amended as provided for in Part A of the Annex to this proclamation. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland 
Security shall implement this quota as soon as practicable, taking into account 
all aluminum articles imports from this country since January 1, 2018.

(3) The ‘‘Article description’’ for heading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS is 
amended by deleting ‘‘of Brazil, of Canada, of Mexico, or of the member 
countries of the European Union’’. 
(4) For the purposes of administering the quantitative limitations applicable 
to subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.06 for Argentina, the annual 
aggregate limits set out in Part B of the Annex to this proclamation shall 
apply for the period starting with calendar year 2018 and for subsequent 
years, unless modified or terminated. The quantitative limitations applicable 
to subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.06 for Argentina, which for cal endar year 2018 shall take into account all aluminum articles imports from 
Argentina since January 1, 2018, shall be effective for aluminum articles 
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, 
on or after June 1, 2018, and shall be implemented by CBP as soon as 
practicable, consistent with the superior text to subheadings 9903.85.05 
through 9903.85.06. The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor the implemen tation of the quantitative limitations applicable to subheadings 9903.85.05 
through 9903.85.06 and shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, 
the United States Trade Representative, and such other senior Executive 
Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, inform the President 
of any circumstance that in the Secretary’s opinion might indicate that 
an adjustment of the quantitative limitations is necessary. 
(5) The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with CBP and with other 
relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so 
that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed in this 
proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification to the

of Proclamation 9710, as amended, is further amended by inserting the 
phrase ‘‘or quantitative limitations’’ after the words ‘‘ad valorem rates of 
duty’’ in the first and second sentences.

‘‘as amended by clause 1 of this proclamation,’’ and inserting in lieu thereof 
the following phrase: ‘‘as amended, or to the quantitative limitations estab lished by proclamation,’’ in the first sentence. Clause 4 of Proclamation 
9739 is further amended by striking the words ‘‘by clause 3 of this proclama tion’’ from the second sentence. 
(8) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency.

ANNEX 
TO MODIFY CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 99 OF 
THE HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE OF THE UNITED STATES

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 10060 of August 6, 2020 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The 
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles 
were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under 
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the 
United States. 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent 
ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further 
stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the 
threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that 
country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country 
arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national 
security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer 
threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restric tion on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, 
adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security 
interests of the United States require. 
3. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I noted that the United States had successfully 
concluded discussions with Canada on satisfactory alternative means to 
address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by alu minum imports from Canada. In particular, the United States agreed on 
a range of measures with Canada that were expected to allow imports 
of aluminum from Canada to remain stable at historical levels without 
meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to 
remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the 
Secretary’s report. These included measures to monitor for and avoid import 
surges. 
4. In light of this agreement, I determined that, under the framework in 
the agreement, imports of aluminum from Canada would no longer threaten 
to impair the national security, and thus I decided to exclude Canada from 
the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. I noted that the 
United States would monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the 
measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our national security needs, 
and that I may revisit this determination as appropriate. 
5. In Proclamation 9704, I also directed the Secretary to monitor imports 
of aluminum articles and inform me of any circumstances that in the Sec retary’s opinion might indicate the need for further action under section

49922 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 158 / Friday, August 14, 2020 / Presidential Documents 
232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to 
such imports. 
6. The Secretary has now advised me that imports of non-alloyed unwrought 
aluminum from Canada, which accounted for 59 percent of total aluminum 
imports from Canada during June 2019 through May 2020, increased substan tially in the twelve months following my decision to exclude, on a long term basis, Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. Imports 
of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada during June 2019 through 
May 2020 increased 87 percent compared to the prior twelve-month period 
and exceeded the volume of any full calendar year in the previous decade. 
Moreover, imports of these articles from Canada continue to increase, reach ing in June of this year the highest level of any month since I decided 
to adjust imports of aluminum articles in Proclamation 9704. The increase 
in imports of these articles from Canada is principally responsible for the 
27 percent increase in total aluminum imports from Canada during June 
2019 through May 2020. 
7. Canada is the largest source of United States imports of non-alloyed 
unwrought aluminum, accounting for nearly two-thirds of total imports of 
these articles from all countries in 2019 and approximately 75 percent 
of total imports in the first five months of 2020. The surge in imports 
of these articles from Canada coincides with a decrease in imports of these 
articles from other countries and threatens to harm domestic aluminum 
production and capacity utilization. 
8. In light of the Secretary’s information, I have determined that the measures 
agreed upon with Canada are not providing an effective alternative means 
to address the threatened impairment to our national security from imports 
of aluminum from Canada. Thus, I have determined that it is necessary 
and appropriate to re-impose the 10 percent ad valorem tariff proclaimed 
in Proclamation 9704, as amended, on imports of non-alloyed unwrought 
aluminum articles from Canada, commensurate with the tariff imposed on 
such articles imported from most countries. 
9. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation and 
effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our 
national security needs, including with respect to imports of other aluminum 
articles. In particular, the United States will monitor for import surges 
of articles that continue to be exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclama tion 9704, to ensure that exports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum to 
the United States are not simply reoriented into increased exports of alloyed, 
further processed, or wrought aluminum articles. 
10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in 
the second sentence by deleting ‘‘and’’ before ‘‘(d)’’ and inserting before 
the period at the end: ‘‘, (e) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on August 16, 2020, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, and 
Mexico; and (f) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August

16, 2020, from Canada, except with respect to imports of non-alloyed un wrought aluminum provided for in subheading 7601.10, which shall be 
subject to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty’’. 
(2) The Secretary, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
and other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall revise the 
HTSUS so that it conforms to the amendments and effective dates directed 
in this proclamation. The Secretary shall publish any such modification 
to the HTSUS in the Federal Register. 
(3) The modifications made by clause 1 of this proclamation shall be 
effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on August 16, 2020, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are 
expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. 
(4) Any exclusion of aluminum articles from Canada granted by the Sec retary of Commerce pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, 
that has not expired shall be valid under the modifications to the HTSUS 
made by this proclamation. Previously granted exclusions that have expired 
may be renewed. 
(5) Any imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada 
provided for in subheading 7601.10 that were admitted into a United States 
foreign trade zone under ‘‘privileged foreign status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 
146.41 prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, shall 
be subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date 
to the 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, 
as amended. Any imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from 
Canada provided for in subheading 7601.10, except any articles that are 
eligible for admission under ‘‘domestic status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, 
that are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 
a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, shall be admitted only 
as ‘‘privileged foreign status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and shall be 
subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time and date to 
the 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, 
as amended. 
(6) Non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles provided for in subheading 
7601.10 shall not be subject upon entry for consumption to the duty estab lished in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, merely by reason 
of manufacture in a U.S. foreign trade zone. However, non-alloyed unwrought 
aluminum articles provided for in subheading 7601.10 admitted to a U.S. 
foreign trade zone in ‘‘privileged foreign status’’ pursuant to clause 5 of 
this proclamation, shall retain that status consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e). 
(7) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed 
pursuant to this proclamation. 
(8) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency.

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent 
ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada 
and Mexico. I further stated that any country with which we have a security 
relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways 
to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by 
imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and 
any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the 
threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from 
that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove 
or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country 
and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the 
national security interests of the United States require. 
3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I noted the continuing discussions with the Argentine 
Republic (Argentina), the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), the Federa tive Republic of Brazil (Brazil), Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea 
(South Korea), and the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member coun tries, on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment 
to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from those countries. 
Recognizing that each of these countries and the EU has an important 
security relationship with the United States, I determined that the necessary 
and appropriate means to address the threat to national security posed 
by imports of aluminum articles from these countries was to continue the 
ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these 
countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 
2018. 
4. The United States has agreed in principle with Argentina, Australia, 
and Brazil on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impair ment to our national security posed by aluminum articles imported from 
these countries. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means 
to address the threat to national security posed by imports of aluminum 
articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil is to extend the temporary 
exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704, in order to finalize the details of these satisfactory alternative means 
to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by 
aluminum articles imported from these countries. In my judgment, and

20678 Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 88 / Monday, May 7, 2018 / Presidential Documents 
for the reasons I stated in paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9710, these discus sions will be most productive if aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, 
and Brazil remain exempt from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, 
until the details can be finalized and implemented by proclamation. Because 
the United States has agreed in principle with these countries, in my judg ment, it is unnecessary to set an expiration date for the exemptions. Neverthe less, if the satisfactory alternative means are not finalized shortly, I will 
consider re-imposing the tariff. 
5. The United States is continuing discussions with Canada, Mexico, and 
the EU. I have determined that the necessary and appropriate means to 
address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum 
articles from these countries is to continue these discussions and to extend 
the temporary exemption of these countries from the tariff proclaimed in 
Proclamation 9704, at least at this time. In my judgment, and for the reasons 
I stated in paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9710, these discussions will be 
most productive if aluminum articles from these countries remain exempt 
from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. 
6. For the reasons I stated in paragraph 11 of Proclamation 9710, however, 
the tariff imposed by Proclamation 9704 remains an important first step 
in ensuring the economic stability of our domestic aluminum industry and 
removing the threatened impairment of the national security. As a result, 
unless I determine by further proclamation that the United States has reached 
a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to 
the national security by imports of aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, 
and the member countries of the EU, the tariff set forth in clause 2 of 
Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries. 
7. I have determined that, in light of the ongoing discussions that may 
result in long-term exclusions from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current 
tariff level as it applies to other countries. 
8. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) Imports of all aluminum articles from Argentina, Australia, and Brazil 
shall be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 
9704, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9710. Imports of all aluminum 
articles from Canada, Mexico, and the member countries of the EU shall 
be exempt from the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704 
until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018. Further, clause 
2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by clause 1 of Proclamation 9710, 
is also amended by striking the last two sentences and inserting in lieu 
thereof the following two sentences: ‘‘Except as otherwise provided in this 
proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclama tion, all aluminum articles imports specified in the Annex shall be subject 
to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods 
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,

or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 1, 2018, from all countries 
except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the member coun tries of the European Union, and (c) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight 
time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, and

apply to imports of aluminum articles from each country as specified in 
the preceding sentence.’’ 
(2) The exemption afforded to aluminum articles from Canada, Mexico, 
and the member countries of the EU shall apply only to aluminum articles 
of such countries entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, through the close of May 31, 2018, at which time such 
countries shall be deleted from the article description of heading 9903.85.01 
of the HTSUS. 
(3) Clause 5 of Proclamation 9710 is amended by inserting the phrase 
‘‘, except those eligible for admission under ‘‘domestic status’’ as defined 
in 19 CFR 146.43, which is subject to the duty imposed pursuant to Proclama tion 9704, as amended by Proclamation 9710,’’ after the words ‘‘Any alu minum article’’ in the first and second sentences. 
(4) Aluminum articles shall not be subject upon entry for consumption 
to the duty established in clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by 
clause 1 of this proclamation, merely by reason of manufacture in a U.S. 
foreign trade zone. However, aluminum articles admitted to a U.S. foreign 
trade zone in ‘‘privileged foreign status’’ pursuant to clause 5 of Proclamation 
9710, as amended by clause 3 of this proclamation, shall retain that status 
consistent with 19 CFR 146.41(e). 
(5) No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed 
on any aluminum article pursuant to Proclamation 9704, as amended by 
clause 1 of this proclamation. 
(6) The Secretary, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
of the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant executive depart ments and agencies, shall revise the HTSUS so that it conforms to the 
amendments and effective dates directed in this proclamation. The Secretary 
shall publish any such modification to the HTSUS in the Federal Register. 
(7) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency.

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9776 of August 29, 2018 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The 
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under 
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the 
United States. In light of this conclusion, the Secretary recommended action 
to adjust the imports of aluminum articles so that such imports will not 
threaten to impair the national security. The Secretary also recommended 
that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic 
parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum 
articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient 
domestic production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude alu minum articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based 
considerations. 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, are being imported 
into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances 
as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and 
decided to adjust the imports of these aluminum articles by imposing a 
10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. 
I further authorized the Secretary to provide relief from these additional 
duties for any aluminum article determined not to be produced in the 
United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfac tory quality and also to provide such relief based on specific national security 
considerations. 
3. Consistent with the Secretary’s recommendation that I authorize him 
to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those aluminum articles 
for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient domestic 
production of comparable products, or for specific national security-based 
considerations, I have determined to authorize the Secretary to provide 
relief from quantitative limitations on aluminum articles adopted pursuant 
to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, including 
those set forth in Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports 
of Aluminum Into the United States), on the same basis as the Secretary 
is currently authorized to provide relief from the duty established in clause 
2 of Proclamation 9704. 
4. In light of my determinations, I have considered whether it is necessary 
and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any 
corresponding adjustments to the tariff or quotas imposed by previous procla mations. It is my judgment that it is necessary and appropriate, at this 
time, to maintain the current tariff and quota levels. As directed in Proclama tion 9704, the Secretary shall continue to monitor imports of aluminum 
articles and inform me of any circumstances that, in his opinion, might

45020 Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 171 / Tuesday, September 4, 2018 / Presidential Documents 
indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion 
Act of 1962, as amended. 
5. The United States continues to hold discussions with countries on satisfac tory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national 
security posed by aluminum articles imports. Should these discussions result 
in an agreement concerning such alternative means, I will take further action 
as appropriate. 
6. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the United States Trade Representa tive (USTR), the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 
the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and such other senior 
Executive Branch officials as the Secretary deems appropriate, is hereby 
authorized to provide relief from the quantitative limitations applicable to 
aluminum articles described in subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06 of 
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS for any aluminum article deter mined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably 
available amount or of a satisfactory quality, and is also authorized to 
provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations. 
Such relief shall be provided for an aluminum article only after a request 
for relief is made by a directly affected party located in the United States. 
Such relief may be provided to directly affected parties on a party-by party basis taking into account the regional availability of particular articles, 
the ability to transport articles within the United States, and any other 
factors as the Secretary deems appropriate. If the Secretary determines that 
relief should be granted to a requesting party for the importation of a 
particular aluminum article, the Secretary shall publicly post such determina tion and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department 
of Homeland Security concerning such article so that it will be excluded 
from the applicable quantitative limitation. Relief granted under this clause 
shall apply only to an article entered for consumption, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after the date on which the request 
for relief is granted by the Secretary. Until such time as any applicable 
quantitative limitation for a particular article has been reached, CBP shall 
count any aluminum article for which relief is granted under this clause 
toward such quantitative limitation at the time when such aluminum article 
is entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption. 
Any aluminum article for which relief is granted under this clause shall 
not be subject to the additional rate of duty set forth in Proclamation 
9704, as amended. Aluminum articles for which relief is granted under 
this clause shall be subject to the duty treatment provided in subheading 
9903.85.11 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, as established 
by the Annex to this proclamation. 
(2) As soon as practicable, the Secretary shall issue procedures for the 
requests for exclusion described in clause 1 of this proclamation. The 
issuance of such procedures is exempt from Executive Order 13771 of January

30, 2017 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs). CBP shall 
implement exclusions granted pursuant to clause 1 of this proclamation 
as soon as practicable. 
(3) Clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended by Proclamation 9710, 
is further amended by striking the fourth and fifth sentences and inserting 
in lieu thereof the following two sentences: ‘‘If the Secretary determines 
that a particular aluminum article should be excluded, the Secretary shall 
publicly post such determination and notify U.S. Customs and Border Protec tion (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security concerning such article 
so that it will be excluded from the duties described in clause 2 of this 
proclamation. For merchandise entered for consumption, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after the date the duty established under 
this proclamation is effective and with respect to which liquidation is not 
final, such relief shall be retroactive to the date the request for relief was 
accepted by the Department of Commerce.’’. 
(4) Where the government of a country identified in the superior text 
to subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06 of subchapter III of chapter 99 
of the HTSUS notifies the United States that it has established a mechanism 
for the certification of exports to the United States of products covered 
by the quantitative limitations applicable to these subheadings, and where 
such mechanism meets the operational requirements for participation in 
an export certification system administered by the United States, CBP, in 
consultation with the Secretary, USTR, and other relevant executive depart ments and agencies, may require that importers of these products furnish 
relevant export certification information in order to qualify for the treatment 
set forth in subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06. Where CBP adopts 
such a requirement, it shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the 
requirement and procedures for the submission of relevant export certification 
information. No article that is subject to the export certification requirement 
announced in such notice may be entered for consumption, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective date specified 
in such notice, except upon presentation of a valid and properly executed 
certification, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the notice. 
(5) Subdivision (c) of U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of 
the HTSUS is amended by inserting at the end the following new sentence: 
‘‘Pursuant to subheading 9903.85.11 and superior text thereto, the Secretary 
may provide that any excluded product shall be granted entry into the 
customs territory of the United States when the applicable quantitative limita tion has filled for the specified period for such good.’’. 
(6) Subdivision (d) of U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of 
the HTSUS is amended by inserting after ‘‘9903.85.06’’ the phrase ‘‘and 
9903.85.11’’. 
(7) The superior text for subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06 of the 
HTSUS is amended by deleting ‘‘Aluminum’’ and inserting in lieu thereof: 
‘‘Except as provided in subheading 9903.85.11, aluminum’’. 
(8) To implement clause 1 of this proclamation, subchapter III of chapter 
99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(9) The modifications to the HTSUS made by clauses 5 through 8 of 
this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective 
with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 
30, 2018, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly 
reduced, modified, or terminated. 
(10) Clause 5 of Proclamation 9704 is amended by inserting ‘‘for consump tion’’ after ‘‘goods entered’’ in the first sentence. Clause 5 of Proclamation 
9710, as amended, is amended by striking ‘‘by this proclamation’’ from 
the end of the second sentence. Clause 5 of Proclamation 9739 is amended 
by striking ‘‘by clause 1 of this proclamation’’.

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 10106 of October 27, 2020 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The 
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles 
were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under 
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the 
United States. 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent 
ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further 
stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the 
threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that 
country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country 
arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national 
security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer 
threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restric tion on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, 
adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security 
interests of the United States require. 
3. In Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I noted that the United States had successfully 
concluded discussions with Canada on satisfactory alternative means to 
address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by alu minum imports from Canada. In particular, the United States agreed on 
a range of measures with Canada that were expected to allow imports 
of aluminum from Canada to remain stable at historical levels without 
meaningful increases, thus permitting the domestic capacity utilization to 
remain reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the 
Secretary’s report. These included measures to monitor for and avoid import 
surges. 
4. In light of this agreement, I determined that, under the framework in 
the agreement established with Canada, imports of aluminum from Canada 
would no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I decided 
to exclude Canada from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as 
amended. I noted that the United States would monitor the implementation 
and effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing 
our national security needs, and that I may revisit this determination as 
appropriate. 
5. In Proclamation 10060 of August 6, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I noted that imports of non-alloyed unwrought

68710 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 211 / Friday, October 30, 2020 / Presidential Documents 
aluminum from Canada had increased substantially following my decision 
to exclude, on a long-term basis, Canada from the tariff proclaimed in 
Proclamation 9704. I further noted that this surge in imports coincided 
with a decrease in imports of these articles from other countries and threat ened to harm domestic aluminum production and capacity utilization. In 
light of these circumstances, I determined that it was necessary and appro priate to re-impose the 10 percent ad valorem tariff proclaimed in Proclama tion 9704, as amended, on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum 
articles from Canada. 
6. The United States has held consultations with Canada regarding exports 
of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada to the United States. 
On the basis of these consultations, the United States expects that exports 
of these articles from Canada to the United States will decrease significantly 
in the remaining months of 2020, from a monthly average of approximately 
154,000 metric tons in the first 7 months of this year to a monthly average 
of approximately 77,000 tons in September through December. This 50 per cent decrease in the volume would reduce United States imports of non alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada to a level below the average 
of monthly imports of these articles from Canada in any calendar year 
in the past decade, thus alleviating the threatened harm to domestic alu minum production and capacity utilization posed by the previous surge 
in imports of these articles. 
7. In light of these changed circumstances, and in view of the measures 
previously agreed upon with Canada to address the threatened impairment 
of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada, as de scribed in Proclamation 9893, I have determined that imports of aluminum 
from Canada will no longer threaten to impair the national security, and 
thus I have decided to reinstate Canada’s exclusion from the tariff on these 
articles proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended. As specified in this 
proclamation, I may re-impose the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 
on imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada in the event 
that the volume of imports of these articles from Canada in the remaining 
months of 2020 exceeds the quantities that the United States expects will 
be exported from Canada to the United States during this period. The United 
States and Canada expect to hold further consultations in December 2020 
to discuss the state of aluminum trade between the two countries in light 
of trade patterns in the last 4 months of 2020 and expected market conditions 
in 2021. 
8. The United States will continue to monitor the implementation and 
effectiveness of the measures agreed upon with Canada in addressing our 
national security needs, as described in Proclamation 9893, both with respect 
to imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum and imports of other alu minum articles. 
9. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows:

(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in 
the second sentence by deleting ‘‘and’’ before ‘‘(f)’’ and inserting before 
the period at the end: ‘‘, and (g) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight 
time on September 1, 2020, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, 
Canada, and Mexico.’’. 
(2) In order to establish the removal of the additional duty rate on imports 
of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, subchapter III of chapter 
99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(3) The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representa tive, shall continue to monitor imports of aluminum articles, in particular 
imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada. In the event 
that imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada exceed 105 
percent of the volumes set forth below for any month, I will consider 
re-imposing the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of these 
articles from Canada, which may include retroactive application to articles 
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, 
on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020. The 
volumes are: 83,000,000 kilograms for September 2020; 70,000,000 kilograms 
for October 2020; 83,000,000 kilograms for November 2020; and 70,000,000 
kilograms for December 2020. In the event that imports of non-alloyed 
unwrought aluminum from Canada exceed 105 percent of the volumes above 
for any month, I may consider whether the volume stipulated for the fol lowing month is reduced by the amount of the excess in making my deter mination whether to re-impose the tariff. I may also consider re-imposing 
the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of these articles from 
Canada based on the outcome of consultations between the United States 
and Canada in December 2020 and expected market conditions in 2021. 
(4) The modifications made by clause 1 of this proclamation and the 
Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered 
for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, and shall 
continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, 
or terminated. 
(5) Imports of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada 
provided for in subheading 7601.10, except any articles that are eligible 
for admission under ‘‘domestic status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, that 
are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 
a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, shall continue to be admit ted only as ‘‘privileged foreign status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and 
shall not be subject upon entry for consumption on or after such time 
and date to the duty treatment provided for in heading 9903.85.21, unless 
and until heading 9903.85.21 becomes applicable to these articles. Imports 
of non-alloyed unwrought aluminum articles from Canada provided for in 
subheading 7601.10, admitted into a United States foreign trade zone before 
12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, under ‘‘privileged 
foreign status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, shall remain subject upon 
entry for consumption on or after such time and date to the additional 
10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amend ed. 
(6) In the event that I decide, as described in clause 3 of this proclamation, 
to re-impose the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 to imports of non alloyed unwrought aluminum from Canada, including possible retroactive 
application of the tariff, no drawback shall be available with respect to 
such duties imposed. 
(7) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency.

ANNEX 
TO MODIFY CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 99 OF 
THE HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 1, 2020, and until such time 
as further modified, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States is modified by striking subdivision (iv) of U.S. note 19(a) and inserting in its place the

“(iv) Heading 9903.85.21 provides the ordinary customs duty treatment for unwrought 
aluminum, non-alloyed, provided for in subheading 7601.10 that is the product of 
Canada, entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on 
or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 16, 2020, through 12:00 a.m. on 
September 1, 2020, and during any subsequent period of effectiveness that may be 
provided under the terms of this note. Heading 9903.85.21 shall not be used for 
unwrought aluminum, non-alloyed, provided for in subheading 7601.10 that is the

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9893 of May 19, 2019 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The 
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles 
were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under 
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the 
United States. 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent 
ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. 
3. In Proclamation 9704, I further stated that any country with which we 
have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States 
alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security 
caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United 
States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to 
address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports 
from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I 
may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from 
that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, 
as the national security interests of the United States require. 
4. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with Canada 
and Mexico on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened im pairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from Canada 
and Mexico. The United States has agreed on a range of measures with 
Canada and Mexico to prevent the importation of aluminum that is unfairly 
subsidized or sold at dumped prices, to prevent the transshipment of alu minum, and to monitor for and avoid import surges. These measures are 
expected to allow imports of aluminum from Canada and Mexico to remain 
stable at historical levels without meaningful increases, thus permitting the 
domestic capacity utilization to remain reasonably commensurate with the 
target level recommended in the Secretary’s report. In my judgment, these 
measures will provide effective, long-term alternative means to address the 
contribution of these countries’ imports to the threatened impairment of 
the national security. 
5. In light of these agreements, I have determined that, under the framework 
in the agreements, imports of aluminum from Canada and Mexico will 
no longer threaten to impair the national security, and thus I have decided 
to exclude Canada and Mexico from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704, as amended. The United States will monitor the implementation and 
effectiveness of these measures in addressing our national security needs, 
and I may revisit this determination as appropriate.

6. In light of my determination to exclude, on a long-term basis, these 
countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, 
I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our 
national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such 
tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of 
the agreed-upon measures with Canada and Mexico, it is necessary and 
appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies 
to other countries. 
7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.

of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in 
the second sentence by deleting the ‘‘and’’ before ‘‘(c)’’ and inserting before 
the period at the end: ‘‘, and (d) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight 
time on May 20, 2019, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, 
and Mexico’’. 
(2) The ‘‘Article description’’ for heading 9903.85.01, in subchapter III 
of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, is amended by replacing ‘‘of Australia’’ with 
‘‘of Australia, of Canada, of Mexico’’. 
(3) The modifications made by clauses 1 and 2 of this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or with drawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern 
daylight time on May 20, 2019, and shall continue in effect, unless such 
actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated. 
(4) Any imports of aluminum articles from Canada and Mexico that were 
admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under ‘‘privileged foreign status’’ 
as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on May 20, 2019, shall not be subject upon entry for consumption made 
after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 20, 2019, to the additional 
10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amend ed.

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 10139 of January 19, 2021 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum 
articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The 
Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles 
were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under 
such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the 
United States. 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s finding that aluminum 
articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and 
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security 
of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, 
as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent 
ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further 
stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the 
threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that 
country. I also noted that, should the United States and any such country 
arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national 
security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer 
threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restric tion on aluminum article imports from that country and, if necessary, make 
corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as 
the national security interests of the United States require. 
3. The United States has an important security relationship with the United 
Arab Emirates, including our shared commitment to supporting each other 
in addressing national security concerns in the Middle East, particularly 
in countering Iran’s malign influence there; combatting violent extremism 
around the world; and maintaining the strong economic ties between our 
countries. 
4. In light of the foregoing, the United States has engaged in discussions 
with the United Arab Emirates on alternative means to address the threatened 
impairment to our national security posed by aluminum article imports 
from the United Arab Emirates. On the basis of these discussions, the United 
States and the United Arab Emirates have now agreed on satisfactory alter native means to address this threat. 
5. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with the United 
Arab Emirates on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened 
impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from the 
United Arab Emirates, specifically a quota restricting the quantity of alu minum articles imported into the United States from the United Arab Emir ates. This measure is expected to allow imports of aluminum from the 
United Arab Emirates to remain close to historical levels without meaningful 
increases, thus making it more likely that domestic capacity utilization will

6826 Federal Register / Vol. 86, No. 14 / Monday, January 25, 2021 / Presidential Documents 
be reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Sec retary’s report. In my judgment, this measure will provide effective, long term alternative means to address the contribution of the United Arab Emir ates to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining 
aluminum article exports from the United Arab Emirates to the United 
States, limiting export surges by the United Arab Emirates, and discouraging 
excess aluminum capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of 
this agreement, I have determined that aluminum article imports from the 
United Arab Emirates will no longer threaten to impair the national security 
and have decided to exclude the United Arab Emirates from the tariff pro claimed in Proclamation 9704. The United States will monitor the implemen tation and effectiveness of the measure agreed with the United Arab Emirates 
in addressing our national security needs, and this determination may be 
revisited, as appropriate. 
6. In light of my determination to exclude the United Arab Emirates from 
the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, I have considered 
whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security 
interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies 
to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon 
measure with the United Arab Emirates, it is necessary and appropriate, 
at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries. 
7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in 
the second sentence by deleting ‘‘and’’ before ‘‘(g)’’ and inserting before 
the period at the end: ‘‘, and (h) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard 
time on February 3, 2021, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, 
Canada, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates.’’. 
(2) Clauses 1 and 4 of Proclamation 9776 of August 29, 2018 (Adjusting 
Imports of Aluminum Into the United States) are amended by replacing, 
in each instance, ‘‘subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06’’ with ‘‘sub headings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.08’’. 
(3) The ‘‘Article Description’’ for subheading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS 
is amended by replacing ‘‘of Argentina, of Australia, of Canada, of Mexico’’ 
with ‘‘of Argentina, of Australia, of Canada, of Mexico, of the United Arab 
Emirates’’. 
(4) The superior text to subheading 9903.85.11 of the HTSUS is amended 
by replacing ‘‘of Argentina’’ with ‘‘of Argentina and of the United Arab 
Emirates’’, and the ‘‘Article Description’’ for subheading 9903.85.11 of the 
HTSUS is amended by replacing ‘‘9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06’’ with 
‘‘9903.85.05 through 9903.85.08’’. 
(5) In order to implement quantitative limitations on aluminum article 
imports from the United Arab Emirates, subchapter III of chapter 99 of 
the HTSUS is amended as provided for in Part A of the Annex to this 
proclamation. For purposes of administering these quantitative limitations, 
the annual aggregate limits set out in Part B of the Annex to this proclamation

and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods 
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, 
on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 3, 2021, and

or terminated. 
(7) Any imports of aluminum articles from the United Arab Emirates 
that were admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under ‘‘privileged foreign 
status’’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern standard 
time on February 3, 2021, shall not be subject, upon entry for consumption 
made on or after that date and time, to the additional 10 percent ad valorem 
rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amended, and shall be 
subject to the quantitative limitations established in this proclamation. 
(8) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day 
of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty-one, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and forty-fifth.

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 10144 of February 1, 2021 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. Proclamation 10139 of January 19, 2021 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), amended Proclamation 9704 (Adjusting Imports of 
Aluminum Into the United States), as amended, with respect to tariffs on 
certain imports of aluminum articles proclaimed under section 232 of the 
Trade Expansion Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). Proclamation 10139 
provides that those amendments will not take effect until 12:01 a.m. on 
February 3, 2021. 
2. I consider it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security 
interests to maintain, at this time, the tariff treatment applied to aluminum 
article imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) under Proclamation 
9704, as amended, as they are currently in effect as of this date. Accordingly, 
and as provided for in clause (6) of Proclamation 10139, I am terminating 
the modifications contained in that proclamation before they take effect. 
3. Proclamation 9704 applied tariffs to help ensure the economic viability 
of the domestic aluminum industry—an industry that the Secretary of Com merce had previously identified as essential to our critical industries and 
national defense. Because robust domestic aluminum production capacity 
is essential to meet our current and future national security needs, Proclama tion 9704 aimed to revive idled aluminum facilities, open closed smelters 
and mills, preserve necessary skills, and maintain or increase domestic 
production by reducing United States reliance on foreign producers. 
4. In my view, the available evidence indicates that imports from the UAE 
may still displace domestic production, and thereby threaten to impair our 
national security. Proclamation 9704 authorized the Secretary of Commerce 
to grant exclusions from the aluminum tariffs based on specific national 
security considerations or if specific imported aluminum articles were deter mined not to be produced sufficiently in the United States, such that the 
imports would not diminish domestic production. Tellingly, there have been 
33 such exclusion requests for aluminum imported from the UAE, covering 
587,007 metric tons of articles, and the Secretary of Commerce has denied 
32 of those requests, covering 582,007 metric tons. This indicates the large 
degree of overlap between imports from the UAE and what our domestic 
industry is capable of producing. 
5. Since the tariff on aluminum imports was imposed, such imports substan tially decreased, including a 25 percent reduction from the UAE, and domes tic aluminum production increased by 22 percent through 2019, before the 
coronavirus pandemic began. In light of that history, I believe that maintain ing the tariff is likely to be more effective in protecting our national security 
than the untested quota described in Proclamation 10139. 
6. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 10327 of December 27, 2021 
Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to the President a report on the Secretary’s investigation into the effect 
of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United 
States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended 
(19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of his 
opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States 
in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair 
the national security of the United States. 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary’s finding 
that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such 
quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national 
security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum 
articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported 
from all countries except Canada and Mexico. Proclamation 9704 further 
stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is wel come to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the 
threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that 
country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country 
arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national 
security such that the President determines that imports from that country 
no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove 
or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country 
and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the 
national security interests of the United States require. 
3. In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), the President noted the continuing discussions with 
the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries on satisfactory 
alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national secu rity by aluminum articles imported from the EU. Recognizing that the EU 
has an important security relationship with the United States, the President 
determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat 
to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from the 
member countries of the EU was to continue the ongoing discussions and 
to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff 
proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 2018. In Proclamation 9739 
of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), 
the President noted that, unless the President determines by further proclama tion that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means 
to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports 
of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU, the tariff pro claimed in Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these 
countries. 
4. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with the EU 
on behalf of its member countries on satisfactory alternative means to address 
the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum

articles imports from the EU. The United States and the EU have agreed 
to expand coordination involving trade remedies and customs matters, mon itor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market 
excess capacity, and annually review their arrangement and their ongoing 
cooperation. In addition, the United States and the EU will seek to conclude, 
by October 31, 2023, negotiations on global steel and aluminum arrangements 
to restore market-oriented conditions and support the reduction of carbon 
intensity of steel and aluminum across modes of production. 
5. The United States will implement a number of actions, including a 
tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of aluminum articles imported 
into the United States from the EU without the application of the tariff 
proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. Under the arrangement, aluminum articles 
that area accompanied by a certificate of analysis are eligible for in-quota 
treatment. In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long term alternative means to address any contribution by EU aluminum articles 
imports to the threatened impairment to the national security by restraining 
aluminum articles imports to the United States from the EU, limiting trans shipment, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production. In 
light of this agreement, I have determined that specified volumes of eligible 
aluminum articles imports from the EU will no longer threaten to impair 
the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from the 
EU up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704 through December 31, 2023. The United States will monitor the imple mentation and effectiveness of the tariff-rate quota and other measures agreed 
upon with the EU in addressing our national security needs, and I may 
revisit this determination, as appropriate. 
6. The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, align with the 
recommendations specified in the Secretary’s report assessing the effect of 
imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States 
under section 232. The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume, total ing 18,000 metric tons of unwrought aluminum and 366,040 metric tons 
of semi-finished wrought aluminum, is consistent with the objective of reach ing and sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic 
aluminum industry. 
7. In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 
9704 as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU, I have 
considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national 
security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as 
it applies to other countries. I have determined that it is necessary and 
appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies 
to other countries. 
8. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes 
the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that 
are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such 
circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security. 
9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treat ment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continu ance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim as follows: 
(1) To establish a tariff-rate quota on imports of aluminum articles from

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 
Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and De rivative Steel Articles Into the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
1. On January 11, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted 
to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of steel articles 
on the national security of the United States, and on January 19, 2018, 
the Secretary transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect 
of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United 
States. Both reports were issued pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expan sion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). 
2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), and Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting 
Imports of Steel Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary’s 
findings that aluminum articles and steel articles were being imported into 
the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to 
threaten to impair the national security of the United States. I therefore 
decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 
1 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem 
tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning March 23, 
2018. I also decided to adjust the imports of steel articles, as defined in 
clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, by imposing a 25 percent 
ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries, beginning 
March 23, 2018. 
3. In Proclamation 9758 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum 
Into the United States), I decided to further adjust imports of aluminum 
articles by imposing quotas on such articles from the Argentine Republic 
(Argentina). In Proclamation 9740 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports 
of Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust imports of steel articles 
by imposing quotas on such articles from the Republic of Korea (South 
Korea), and in Proclamation 9759 of May 31, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of 
Steel Into the United States), I decided to adjust imports of steel articles 
by imposing quotas on such articles from Argentina and the Republic of 
Brazil (Brazil). 
4. In Proclamation 9704 and Proclamation 9705, I directed the Secretary 
to monitor imports of aluminum articles and steel articles, respectively, 
and inform me of any circumstances that in the Secretary’s opinion might 
indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion 
Act of 1962, as amended. 
5. The Secretary has informed me that domestic steel producers’ capacity 
utilization has not stabilized for an extended period of time at or above 
the 80 percent capacity utilization level identified in his report as necessary 
to remove the threatened impairment of the national security. Stabilizing 
at that level is important to provide the industry with a reasonable expecta tion that market conditions will prevail long enough to justify the investment
